abstract = {The stability of short period Sc/Cr and Sc/B4C/Cr multilayers was investigated over a large temperature range. The aim was to find a stable reflective coating for an off-axis parabola for focusing x rays from a soft x-ray free-electron laser. Normal incidence reflectivity, surface roughness, and intrinsic stress were investigated as a function of annealing temperature and two samples were also studied with a high-resolution transmission electron microscope (TEM), a scanning TEM, and through electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS). Interface-engineered Sc/B4C/Cr multilayers showed increased thermal stability and higher reflectivity as compared to pure Sc/Cr multilayers.},

	Abstract = {In this paper, we present measurements of angle- and wavelength-resolved diffuse scattering of EUV radiation on a Mo/Si multilayer. Our sample is optimized for high reflectivity at 13.5\&\#xA0;nm wavelength near-normal incidence. We present a rigorous theoretical analysis of the off-specular EUV scattering on the basis of the distorted-wave Born approximation. We prove that the determination of the interface roughness power spectral density (PSD) is only possible by considering geometry-dependent and dynamic contributions. The scattering from multilayer mirrors leads to an intrinsic enhancement in off-specular intensity independent of roughness properties. The thickness oscillations in the scattering intensity (Kiessig fringes) are found to cause additional dynamic enhancement in analogy to Bragg-like peaks for grazing incidence geometry. Considering these effects, the interface PSD is consistently determined.},

This allows to combine the high sensitivity of GIXR data to layer and interface thicknesses with the sensitivity of EUVR to the layer densities and atomic compositions. This method was applied to the reconstruction of the layered structure of a LaN/B multilayer mirror with 3.5 nm periodicity. We have compared profiles obtained by simultaneous EUVR and GIXR and GIXR-only data analysis, both reconstructed profiles result in a similar description of the layered structure. However, the simultaneous analysis of both EUVR and GIXR by a single algorithm lead to a $\sim$2x increased accuracy of the reconstructed layered model, or a more narrow range of solutions, as compared to the GIXR analysis only. It also explains the inherent difficulty of accurately predicting EUV 
reflectivity from a GIXR-only analysis.},

In particular, reflectivity measurements performed at the PTB reflectometer at BESSY II in Berlin revealed a reflectivity of R = 14.8% at an incidence
angle of θ = 1.5° and R = 15.0% at θ = 5°. Simulation results show that the interface widths between the Cr and Sc nanolayers are less than 0.4 nm. The annealing effect in short-period Cr/Sc multilayers was studied in the temperature range from 50°C to 500°C by X-ray scattering and transmission electron microscopy. Structural and phase transformations and the corresponding changes of the optical properties are presented and discussed.},

The data presented are for gold films of 7 and 15{\AA} average thicknesses on Corning 7059 glass substrates. The advantages of this technique are that it is non-destructive, can be done {\it in situ}, provides excellent sampling statistics, does not necessarily require a synchrotron source, and is not limited to thin or conducting substrates.},

  abstract={Pulsed laser deposition (PLD) and magnetron sputter deposition (MSD) have been used to prepare different types of Mo/Si multilayers for the extreme ultraviolet (EUV) spectral range. In the case of PLD prepared Mo/Si multilayers the deposition of 0.3–0.5 nm thick carbon barrier layers at the interfaces leads to a substantial improvement of the interface quality. This can be deduced from Cu-Kα reflectivity measurements and HRTEM observations. Consequently the EUV reflectivity has been substantially increased. For pure Mo/Si-multilayers prepared by MSD the deposition parameters have been optimized so that a normal incidence reflectivity of R EUV =68.7% could be realized. Although this is one of the best experimental results achieved so far, there is still a gap between this experimental value and the theoretical limit ( R EUV =75.5%). One of the main reasons for this discrepancy is the formation of intermixing zones at the interfaces. With B 4 C and C barrier layers at the interfaces interdiffusion 
can be reduced. The resulting EUV reflectivity of this new type of EUV multilayers is 69.8% (λ=13.42 nm, α=1.5°) and 71.4% (λ=12.52 nm, α=22.5°).}
