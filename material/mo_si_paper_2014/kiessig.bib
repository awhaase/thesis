	Abstract = {The light scattering of interference coatings is strongly dependent on the wavelength. In addition to the general strong increase of scattering as the wavelengths get shorter, dramatic scatter effects in and around the resonance regions can occur. This is discussed in detail for highly reflective and chirped mirrors. A new instrument is presented which enables spectral angle resolved scatter measurements of high-quality optical components to be performed between 250 and 1500\&\#xA0;nm.},

	Abstract = {Light scattered from interface imperfections carries valuable information about its origins. For single surfaces, light-scattering techniques have become a powerful tool for the characterization of surface roughness. For thin-film coatings, however, solving the inverse scattering problem seemed to be impossible because of the large number of parameters involved. A simplified model is presented that introduces two parameters: Parameter $\delta$ describes optical thickness deviations from the perfect design, and parameter $\beta$ describes the roughness evolution inside the coating according to a power law. The new method is used to investigate structural and alteration effects of HR coatings for 193nm, as well as laser-induced degradation effects in Rugate filters for 355nm.},

	Abstract = {Special substrate-film designs are used to measure roughness-induced scattering and scattering from the volume of optical thin films separately. So theoretical models of surface roughness and volume scattering become applicable to the experimental data, and quantitative information on thin-film microstructure can be derived. Measuring total integrated and angle-resolved scattering on oxide, fluoride, and chalcogenide films of different film thicknesses yields the evolution law of microstructural growth, which for the majority of investigated films roughly follows a square-root dependence on film thickness. Packing densities of fluoride films calculated from volume-scattering data are found to agree with results from quartz-crystal monitoring.},

@article{Deumie:96,
	Abstract = {We have previously shown that macroscopic roughness spectra measured with light scattering at visible wavelengths were perfectly extrapolated at high spatial frequencies by microscopic roughness spectra measured with atomic force microscopy \[Europhys. Lett. 22, 717 (1993); Proc. SPIE 2253, 614 (1994)\]. These results have been confirmed by numerous experiments \[Proc. SPIE 2253, 614 (1994)\] and allow us today to characterize thin films microstructure from a macroscopic to a microscopic scale. In the first step the comparison of light scattering and atomic force microscopy is completed by optical measurements at UV wavelengths that allow us to superimpose (and no longer extrapolate) the spectra measured by the two techniques. In the second step we extract multiscale parameters that describe the action of thin-film coatings on substrate roughness in all bandwidths. The results obviously depend on materials and substrates and deposition techniques. Electron-beam evaporation, ion-assisted deposition, and ion plating are compared, and the conclusions are discussed in regard to the deposition parameters. Finally, special attention is given to the limits and performances of the two characterization techniques (light scattering and atomic force microscopy) that may be sensitive to different phenomena.},

	Abstract = {Four industries prepared optical coatings with a common design that permits an easy determination of cross-correlation laws between the rough interfaces in the stack. Different pairs of materials and deposition processes were used. After clarifying the differences between scalar and vector theories of light scattering caused by rough interfaces in optical multilayers, we compare the experimental values with both theories. Factors such as variations of correlation with spatial frequency, residual roughness, and slight errors in the design are taken into account for comparison with the vector theory of angular scattering. Correlation of the interface roughnesses is found to be high for practically all coatings. However, at low scatter-loss levels, scattering by localized defects in the coatings appears to dominate over the scattering caused by rough interfaces.},

	Abstract = {We emphasize the role of correlated isotropy in the study of microroughness in high-quality optical coatings. First, cross correlation between surfaces and cross coherence between scattering sources are discussed and compared. An isotropy degree of roughness is then introduced as a quantitative value to describe the angular disorder of a surface connected with the polar dependence of scattering. We show how the frequency variations of this isotropy degree allow one to solve the inverse problem and obtain a unique solution for the scattering parameters that describe structural irregularities of the stacks. Light scattering can also be used to detect an oblique growth of the materials in thin-film form. Finally, we study the sensitivity of the investigation method to the stack parameters.},

	Abstract = {Measurements of angular scattering due to surface roughness were taken from a 24-layer dielectric mirror and compared to theory. In addition, the top surface roughness of the multilayer stack is analyzed from Talystep profilometer measurements. These roughness data are used to obtain a roughness spectral density function to be used in a vector multilayer scattering theory. The theory uses three multilayer stack models to incorporate possible effects of different degrees of correlation between interfaces of the stack. It was found that the angular scattering calculated using the experimentally obtained roughness spectral density function agreed remarkably well with the measured angular scattering data. This is especially true if care is taken to differentiate between particulate and roughness scattering. For the sake of comparison, the angular scattering from an aluminum film is also given, and differences from scattering from the multilayer mirror are noted.},

	Abstract = {Previously published vector equations describing angle-resolved scattering from single-layer- and multilayer-coated optics have been integrated numerically and analytically over all angles in the reflecting hemisphere to obtain numerical results and analytical expressions for total integrated scattering (TIS). The effects of correlation length, polarization, angle of incidence, roughness height distribution, scattered light missed by the collecting hemisphere, and roughness cross-correlation properties of the multilayer stack on the TIS expression are considered. Background material on TIS from optics coated with single opaque reflecting layers is given for completeness and comparison to corresponding multilayer TIS results. It is shown that errors can occur in calculating the true rms surface roughness from actual TIS measurements; ways to correct these errors are discussed.},

	Abstract = {Multilayer structures of molybdenum and silicon have been synthesized
	by sputter deposition onto flat silicon single-crystal silicon substrates
	and spherically ground (0.5- and 22.0-m radii) fused silica substrates
	and the reflectivities for 170.4-{\AA} (72.8-eV), 160.1-{\AA} (77.4-eV),
	and 228-{\AA} (54.4-eV) light measured at near normal incidence.
	Observed peak values ranged from 26.2 to 78\%, the highest reflectivities
	occurring closest to normal incidence. Energy resolutions were ~10
	in all cases. Model calculations were performed using optical constants
	from the literature and experimentally determined multilayer structural
	parameters. In all cases the measured reflectivities were equal to
	or larger (by up to a factor of 2) than the calculated values, a
	result attributed to uncertainty in the optical constants used in
	the calculations. Experimental and calculated angular peak positions
	and energy resolutions were in good agreement. The high reflectivities
	of these molybdenum-silicon structures will make possible application
	of traditional optics approaches in the EUV and support new developments
	including free electron lasers.},

@article{PTBBigRef,
	Abstract = {The development of EUV lithography is critically based on the availability
	of suitable metrology equipment. To meet the industries requirements
	the Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB) recently has installed
	a new EUV reflectometer at the electron storage ring BESSY II. The
	new reflectometer is designed for at-wavelength metrology of full-size
	EUVL optics. Samples with a maximum weight of 50 kg and a diameter
	of up to 550 mm can be investigated. Besides wavelength and angle
	scans also the measurement of bi-directional scattering is possible
	within the full sample surface. Convex and concave shaped surfaces
	are allowed. Not only a single mirror of the projection optics but
	also up to five masks can be mounted simultaneously. For future lithography
	production tools the requirements for the optics and masks are very
	stringent. The homogeneity of the multilayer reflectivity across
	the surface and the wavelength matching of the peak reflection become
	even stronger than today. To meet the increasing demands not only
	regarding the sample size but also regarding the accuracy of the
	measurements the operation of the beamline was further optimized.
	Diffuse scattered light limits the uncertainty in the peak reflectance.
	A total relative uncertainty of 0.14% is achieved with a reproducibility
	of 0.07%. The uncertainty in the center wavelength is mainly given
	by the uncertainty for the reference wavelength of the Kr 3d5/2-5p
	resonance. The reduction of all other sources of uncertainty results
	in a total uncertainty of 0.014% in the center wavelength with a
	reproducibility of 0.008%. We present a detailed description of the
	EUV reflectometer and discuss the optimized beamline conditions with
	the different sources of uncertainties. The results are illustrated
	by recent measurements.},
