\chapter{Summary} \label{ch_summary}
This thesis has treated the characterization Mo/Si and Cr/Sc multilayer mirror systems by means of the combination of several indirect methods based on reflection, fluorescence and scattering using \gls{euv} and X-ray radiation. Its focus was to validate and improve the applied theoretical models and determine the experimental techniques required to achieve an unambiguous solution to the inverse problem. For the reconstruction of the layer systems structure, a \glsdesc{pso} was applied to fit the model parameters to the measured data from \glsdesc{euv} reflectivity, \glsdesc{xrr}, \glsdesc{reuv} and \glsdesc{xrf} experiments. A \glsdesc{mcmc} algorithm was further employed to deduct the maximum likelihood distribution and thereby confidence intervals based on the measurement and model uncertainties. It was found, that different methods and models had to be applied depending on the system under investigation. The values and confidence intervals determined for each parameter of the respective model, allowed to draw conclusions on the actual structural layout of the samples.

The structural characterization methods could yield layer thicknesses, densities and even the distortion of the interfaces. However, they lack in the ability to identify these distortions as either roughness or intermixing. This could only be achieved by combining the results of the structural characterization with a method sensitive to roughness and again validate the accuracy of the result. This issue was approached by the analysis of \gls{euv} diffuse scattering with radiation impinging near-normal incidence as a suitable technique to deliver this distinction method. The method was introduced by analyzing the state-of-the-art Mo/B$_4$C/Si/C mirror reaching \SI{68.5 \pm 0.7}{\percent} peak reflectance at its operation wavelengths of \nm{13.5}. It was revealed that the high quality, and thus reflectivity, of the sample causes resonant enhancement of diffusely scattered radiation within the stack, which significantly contributes to the diffuse scattering intensities. These dynamic effects must be considered in the analysis by employing the theoretical framework of the \glsdesc{dwba} including multiple reflections at the interfaces of the multilayer. With this approach, the roughness properties for the samples could be extracted consistently. By comparing and combining the results of the structural characterization and the roughness analysis a consistent characterization of the multilayer mirrors could be achieved. Thereby, the analysis in this thesis could explain the lack of peak reflectivity compared to the theoretical expectation for an ideal system for both sample systems.

In the unpolished and polished set of the Mo/Si/C multilayer mirrors, it was revealed that the combination of \gls{euv} reflectivity and \glsdesc{xrr} yields an unambiguous result for the molybdenum layer thickness confirming the nominal trend in both sets. The confidence intervals for the molybdenum thickness could be determined ranging from $\nm{0.43}$ down to $\nm{0.24}$, depending on the sample. In comparison, the analysis of \gls{euv} reflectivity for the Mo/B$_4$C/Si/C sample only yielded a confidence interval of approximately $\nm{1}$. This demonstrated the need for combining multiple datasets, despite an excellent agreement of the calculated and measured curves, since multiple solutions exist.
The sum of the thicknesses of all layers in a period shows a distinct increase for both sets at a certain molybdenum layer thickness, associated with a dip in peak reflectance with respect to the theoretical expectation. This effect, while observed in both sets, happens at significantly different molybdenum thicknesses, comparing the unpolished with the polished samples.

The analysis of the diffuse scattering intensity allowed an assessment of the interface morphology for these samples. The comparison with the structural analysis revealed an increase of roughness, associated with the jump in the period thickness and the dip in peak reflectance, which is compensated again at larger thicknesses in both sets. At this point, it may be concluded that these effects are caused by the onset of crystallization in the molybdenum layer, causing increased interface disturbances through roughness. In the analysis of the ion polished set, this threshold was shown to have moved towards lower molybdenum thicknesses. This is beneficial to the reflectance at the optimum molybdenum ratio with respect to the rest of the layers in a period, which in the polished set is now unaffected trough roughening due to crystallization. Nevertheless, comparing the roughness values found in the diffuse scattering analysis with the N{\'e}vot-Croce factor from the optimized layer structure model, it became clear that while overall roughness was reduced significantly and led to a significant increase of the reflectivity in the polished set, the Nev{\'o}t-Croce parameter has only reduced slightly, indicating that intermixing is still largely responsible for the remaining gap to the theoretically achievable reflectivity.

In the case of the Cr/Sc multilayers for the water window spectral range, nominal layer thicknesses within a bilayer period are between \nm{0.7} and \nm{0.8} and thus noticeably thinner than for the Mo/Si systems. It was shown, that an approach to the structural characterization based on a discrete layer model for the chromium and scandium layers does not yield a solution valid for both, the \gls{euv} reflectivity and \gls{xrr} experiments, with the same set of parameters. Thus, a solution fitting the \gls{euv} reflectivity experiment fails to describe the \gls{xrr} curve and vice versa. The discrete layer model is not suitable to describe the physical structure of the sample. Any solution found for either one of the experiments can therefore not be related to the physical properties of the sample. Instead, a model describing a gradual interface profile and layers composed of a mixture of both materials was introduced. Based on this gradual model, the intermixing and roughness were parametrized separately and asymmetric interface profiles could be described explicitly.

It was found through the uniqueness and accuracy analysis, that the increased variability of the improved model requires more complementary information than the analysis of the Mo/Si samples. The goal of unambiguity of the solutions was achieved by performing \gls{euv} reflectivity, \gls{reuv}, \gls{xrr} and \gls{xrf} experiments. Confidence intervals were determined, by evaluating each dataset individually and by combining all in a single analysis. The solutions and confidence intervals determined prove, that only the combination of all datasets could yield a consistent result. It was found, that none of the regions within the Cr/Sc stack are pure chromium or scandium. Furthermore, the interface regions show a strong asymmetry, which could not be determined with the required significance by any of the aforementioned standalone analytic experiments. Not even the combined analysis of these methods could distinguish between roughness and intermixing. Those two parameters were shown to have a strong correlation. To determine roughness and intermixing, the \gls{euv} diffuse scattering was measured and analyzed similarly as for the Mo/Si samples. The result shows a roughness value of $\sigma_r = 0.17  (-0.01/+0.02)$ nm. Consequently, the intermixing could be determined to be $47 (-4/+3)\, \%$, leaving any of the nominal chromium or scandium layers of the stack to contain large amounts of the other material on average. In conclusion, the roughness determined here is comparable to the values found for the polished Mo/Si/C samples. There, this roughness amplitude evidently allowed reflectivities much closer to the theoretical maximum value. Consequently, intermixing could be identified  as the main cause for the small reflectivity achieved with Cr/Sc multilayer mirrors for the water window.

In summary, the work presented in this thesis proves the importance of assessing the uniqueness and accuracy of indirect characterization methods to deduct a meaningful result. As shown on several occasions in the analysis of the multilayer mirrors, reconstructions in very good agreement with the data curves were demonstrated to show ambiguities and inconsistencies. This was revealed by adding complementary information from other experiments or even when analyzing the data of a single experiment using global optimization algorithms. With the approach of combining multiple analytic techniques and determining confidence intervals of the reconstructed parameters, conclusions on the physical properties of the samples could be drawn reliably. This thesis augments the existing characterization methods for multilayer mirrors in that respect.

Finally, with the inclusion of \gls{euv} diffuse scattering, a technique to assess the interface morphology was established. It is suitable for characterization near-normal incidence offering an alternative to grazing-incidence methods such as \gls{gisaxs}. This has some unique advantages as any measurement using small incidence angles is inherently limited to flat or convex surfaces. Focusing mirrors, however, usually are concavely curved and thus characterization techniques with grazing angles of incidence are not applicable . Instead, with \gls{euv} diffuse scattering with radiation impinging near normal incidence, it is possible to extract the roughness information for those samples as well. In addition, radiation at the wavelengths of operation for these mirrors is suitable to conduct this experiment.

As an outlook extending the scope of this work, it would be interesting to evaluate the gain in accuracy and uniqueness of the solutions by applying the compilation of techniques used for the Cr/Sc system, also to the two Mo/Si/C sample sets. This may prove to be beneficial to further reduce the confidence intervals on the results, most prominently on the thickness of the barrier layers. In particular, as a straight forward approach, the improved model for the Cr/Sc mirrors could be carried over to these systems. Thereby, the role of the barrier and compound layers in the crystallization could be investigated based on validated reconstruction parameters. This could augment the analysis conducted on similar systems elsewhere \cite{bajt_investigation_2001}. In general, including further methods would deliver additional complementary information. Ellipsometry, for example, could yield results on the optical constants of the various materials in the layer stack.
