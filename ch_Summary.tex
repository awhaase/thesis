\chapter{Summary and Outlook} \label{ch_summary}
This thesis is dedicated to the characterization of multilayer mirrors systems by means of the combination of several indirect methods based on reflection, fluorescence and scattering using \gls{euv} and X-ray radiation. The systems investigated in this framework belong to two very important applications using wavelengths within the \gls{euv} range. With the semiconductor industry moving towards next-generation lithography systems employing radiation at \nm{13.5}, multilayer mirrors made from Mo/Si layers with the addition of different barrier layers were characterized with respect to their structure and interface morphology. The second system of interest in the presented study are suitable to reflect radiation in the water window spectral range. More specifically, for radiation close to the Sc L-edge at approximately \nm{3.1}. For that purpose, \gls{euv} reflectivity, \gls{xrr}, \gls{reuv} and \gls{xrf} have been applied as methods to determine the layer structure.

It has been demonstrated that the problem of uniqueness and accuracy associated with the structural reconstruction of such systems is of high relevance to deduct reliable reconstructions.
