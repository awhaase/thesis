\section*{Acknowledgement}
At this point, I would like to express my gratitude to all of those who directly or indirectly contributed to the successful completion of this thesis.

First and foremost, I would like to thank Dr.~Frank Scholze, head of the EUV radiometry group at the Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt, for giving me the chance to conduct the work leading to this PhD thesis under his supervision. Our numerous scientific discussions, his valuable ideas and his constructive criticism bundled with the opportunity to conduct experiments even on a short notice, contributed significantly to the success of this thesis. His encouragement and support to present my results to an international scientific audience allowed me to establish contacts and to shape my professional future.

Furthermore, I would like to thank Prof.~Dr.~Mathias Richter for his support and the examination of this thesis. He always had an open ear and valuable advise for the course of my scientific work and the near future. 

I am very grateful to Prof.~Dr.~Stefan Eisebitt for supporting and evaluating my dissertation and to Dr.~Sa\v{s}a Bajt for the fruitful discussions, for providing me with the Cr/Sc samples for my experiments and her willingness to serve as evaluator of this thesis.
