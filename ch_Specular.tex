\chapter{Characterization of the Multilayer Structure for Different Systems} \label{ch_spec}
In this chapter we analyze the structural properties of different multilayer systems. The samples investigated here are highly periodic multilayer systems designed as mirrors to reflect radiation in different spectral ranges. The basic theory behind the principle of a one-dimensional Bragg crystal exploited to achieve high reflectance values, is described in chapter~\ref{ch_theo}. All systems were fabricated using the magnetron sputtering technique discussed in chapter~\ref{ch_exp} with nominal layer thicknesses and chemical species, depending on the desired reflection angle and spectral range. The different samples serve as mirrors for two different wavelength ranges within the \gls{euv} spectrum, the range from \nm{12.4} to \nm{14.0} and the so-called \emph{water window} range from \nm{2.2} to \nm{4.4}. As discussed in Sec.~\ref{ch_theo:sec_multilayer}, the individual layer thicknesses and the required number of periods are intrinsically connected to the spectral range and angles, where maximum reflectance shall be achieved. In case of the systems analyzed within this chapter, the individual layer thicknesses are ranging from approximately \nm{4} down to \nm{0.5}. In addition, each periodic part of the multilayer system is composed out of two to four of these individual layers repeated with a number of periods of $50$ to $400$. For the performance of a multilayer mirrors system, the surface and interface morphology and the actual layer thicknesses and densities of all these layers play a crucial role and affect the reflectivity behavior. Small deviations of the perfect layer layout such as intermixing of the materials or roughness at the interfaces are therefore a significant reason for a diminished reflectivity. While the deposition through the magnetron sputtering process is a well established technique for mirror fabrication, the actual layer thicknesses in the sample may differ from the nominal values and furthermore have imperfections at the interfaces. For an improvement of the deposition process, it is thus essential to assess the morphology and potential intermixing of these highly complex samples.

Based on the matrix algorithm introduced in Sec.~\ref{ch_theo:sec_matrix_algorithm} of Ch.~\ref{ch_theo}, the electromagnetic fields inside and outside an arbitrary layer system upon irradiation with \gls{euv} or X-ray radiation can be calculated. Most importantly, this allows to calculate the expected specular reflectance curves across angular or spectral ranges for a given layer model and even fluorescence expected from certain materials inside the stack. The comparison of these calculated curves to measured data thus allows to obtain information about the actual layer properties in a given sample with a destruction free approach. However, the detected reflectance values in a specular reflection experiment, for example, are typically very simple curves with only a very limited amount of information contained about the rather complex samples. It is thus not possible to directly reconstruct the layout of the sample with the measured reflection curve. This is known as the inverse problem of scatterometry. Reconstructing the layer properties is therefore an attempt of solving this inverse problem by accumulating prior knowledge about the sample, such as the nominal design goals during the fabrication process, into a model of that system. Starting from this model, the theoretically calculated curve is compared to the measured reflectance and optimized iteratively.

This chapter is structured as follows. First, the information content within a simple reflectivity curve for the design wavelength of the mirrors systems is discussed in Sec.~\ref{ch_spec:sec_PTB17} at the example of a mirror for the \gls{euv} range between \nm{12.5} and \nm{14.0}. A reconstruction of the model for that particular system is presented and discussed in conjunction with methods to assess the uniqueness and parameter accuracy. Second, in Sec.~\ref{ch_spec:sec_mo_si_c}, the investigation of a more complex set of samples designed for the same spectral range is conducted. Here, the individual layer thicknesses inside the samples were varied and different polishing methods affecting the interface morphology were applied during fabrication. Based on the analytical experiments conducted here, an improved reconstruction could be obtained by incorporating data from additional \gls{xrr} experiments. Finally, in Sec.~\ref{ch_spec:sec_CrSc}, multilayer mirrors with sub-nanometer layer thicknesses for the water window spectral range are investigated as limiting case of very thin layer systems. There, the combination of multiple analytical experiments is required to deduct a consistent reconstruction of the model.

\section{Reconstruction Based on Specular EUV reflectance} \label{ch_spec:sec_PTB17}

In this section we demonstrate the reconstruction of a multilayer system designed as near-normal incidence mirror for the wavelength range between \nm{12.4} and \nm{14.0} based solely on experimental data of \gls{euv} reflectivity. The mirror was designed to achieve a peak in the reflectance at a wavelength of $\lambda=\nm{13.5}$ for an angle of incidence of $\alpha_i = \SI{6}{\degree}$ with respect to the surface normal. That combination is of relevance for optical setups in the next generation lithography for the semiconductor industry, for which this sample served as a prototype. The multilayer coating was deposited with magnetron sputtering on a polished silicon substrate. The sample contains a periodic layer stack of molybdenum (Mo) and silicon (Si). Due to the problem of intermixing and resulting loss of interface definition, additional barrier layers of boroncarbite (B$_4$C) and carbon (C) were included at the Mo to Si and Si to Mo interfaces, respectively. We shall therefore refer to this sample with the layer sequence within one period from bottom to top as Mo/B$_4$C/Si/C. The number of periods for that system is $N=65$, while the $65th$ (capping) layer period does not posses a carbon layer but terminates at the vacuum interface with the silicon layer and a natural SiO$_2$ oxide layer. A detailed schematic figure of the layer layout can be found in the description of the corresponding theoretical model in Fig.~\ref{ch_spec:fig_Mo_B4C_Si_C_model}.

The sample was measured with respect to its reflectivity across the spectral range mentioned above at an angle of incidence of $\alpha_i=\SI{15}{\degree}$ from the surface normal. The measurement was conducted at the \gls{euvr} beamline at the \gls{mls}. The reflectivity was evaluated by first measuring the intensity of the direct beam in the reflectometer with the photo diode detector. Then, the reflected radiation at an detector angle of $\SI{30}{\degree}$ was measured in reference to the direct beam signal. To ensure the stability of the result, the direct beam was measured again afterwards and compared to the data of the first measurement. The normalized results are shown in Fig.~\ref{ch_spec:fig_ptb17_reflectance_AOI_15}. The measurement uncertainty with this experimental method is within $\SI{0.15}{\percent}$ (one standard deviation, i.e.~a coverage factor of $k=1$) of the peak reflectance value \cite{scholze_high-accuracy_2003} and an angular uncertainty of $\SI{0.01}{\degree}$, which leads to an upper limit for the uncertainty of the reflectivity curve of $\SI{0.4}{\percent}$ in the peak flanks. Consequently, the total uncertainty margin is within the line thickness of the data presentation in Fig.~\ref{ch_spec:fig_ptb17_reflectance_AOI_15}.

\label{ch_spec:fig_ptb17_reflectance_AOI_15}
\end{figure}

The reflectivity curve shows a broad peak attaining its maximum value at a wavelength of approximately \nm{13.1}, which is lower than the design peak reflectance of \nm{13.5} at $\alpha_i = \SI{6}{\degree}$. That is due to the different angle of incidence, $\alpha_i=\SI{15}{\degree}$, used in the experiment. Apart from the main peak, side fringes are visible. They originate from the superposition of waves being reflected at the top surface and the substrate interface. They are thus directly related to the total thickness of the multilayer coating and well known as \emph{Kiessig fringes} \cite{kiessig_interferenz_1931}. Based on the data obtained through this spectrally resolved reflectivity experiment, we shall attempt to reconstruct the unknown layer layout in the following sections. The nominal fabrication parameters serve as starting values for the analysis to build a reasonable model for the reconstruction.

The reconstruction of a given model based on the evaluation of \gls{euv} (or \gls{xrr}) reflectivity data is a well established method for the characterization of multilayer systems  \cite{lim_fabrication_2001, bajt_investigation_2001, braun_mo/si_2002}. In most cases a model is optimized applying gradient methods such as the Levenberg-Marquardt method \cite{levenberg_method_1944, marquardt_algorithm_1963}. Those optimization algorithms typically operate with a set of start parameters within the parameter space and iteratively improve an optimization functional, usually termed $\chi^2$, describing the sum of the squared absolute value of the difference between the theoretical calculation and the experimental data. This is done by calculating the gradient of a that functional in all directions in the parameter space and changing the parameters accordingly in direction of smaller $\chi^2$ values. This approach has the major disadvantage that the end result is strongly dependent on the choice of starting values and may not represent a global minimum of $\chi^2$ but only a local optimum. While estimations of the quality of the fit results within the (local) optimum are possible, no estimation can be given globally for the given model. For those reasons, this characterization strategy has only limited applicability and alternative approaches are required.

In contrast to those gradient methods, heuristic optimization algorithms exist. Instead of operating with predefined starting values, from which a gradient approach minimizes the $\chi^2$ functional, they operate distributed on the whole parameter space with often randomly initialized parameters within given boundaries, instead. In the following we shall apply those heuristic optimization routines to obtain the reconstruction of the Mo/B$_4$C/Si/C sample and elaborate their application to the characterization of multilayer systems in detail.

\subsection{Multilayer Model and Particle Swarm Optimization} \label{ch_spec:sec_reconstruction_PTB17} \label{ch_spec:sec_multilayer_model_and_pso}
For the purpose of reconstructing the layer layout of the Mo/B$_4$C/Si/C sample, a parametrized model is needed entering the theoretical calculations to obtain the reflectivity curve according to the matrix algorithm. The model is largely based on prior knowledge available from the fabrication process. For the multilayer sample investigated here, the nominal layer design is known and a schematic representation is shown in Fig.~\ref{ch_spec:fig_Mo_B4C_Si_C_model}.
\begin{figure}[htbp]

The periodic part is enclosed between the dashed lines with four layers in each period repeated $N=64$ times. The capping period does not include an interdiffusion layer but does reflect the natural oxidation through the addition of a SiO$_2$ layer.}
    \label{ch_spec:fig_Mo_B4C_Si_C_model}
\end{figure}
As introduced above, the multilayer coating consists of a periodic arrangement of four layers replicated 64 times. With the top period being different from the others through the missing carbon interdiffusion layer on the top surface. Since the sample was exposed to ambient conditions, a passivization of the top silicon surface through oxidation has to be taken into account through a silicondioxide layer. The parametrization of that model is given by the thicknesses of each layer within one period as well as for the capping silicondioxide layer. Each of the deposited layers may vary in density with respect to the bulk density of that material \cite{braun_mo/si_2002}, which also needs to be reflected in the model. Finally, the N{\'e}vot-Croce factor $\sigma$ accounting for roughness and interdiffusion at the interfaces as introduced in Eq.~\eqref{ch_theo:eqn_mod_fresnel} of chapter \ref{ch_theo} is also included. The required optical constants, i.e.~the indices of refraction, of the respective materials in the relevant spectral range are taken from tabulated values by \textcite{henke_x-ray_1993} and are used for the theoretical calculations based on the matrix algorithm. At this point, it should be noted that the tabulated optical constants itself come with an uncertainty, which is generally unknown here. In order to account for this, all models within this thesis contain a variable density parameter for each material taken from the Henke database. This acts as a factor on the optical constants and thus takes the uncertainties into account. This parameter is used across all wavelengths in this thesis. As shall be demonstrated later, this does not pose a limitation on the structural reconstruction, as the sensitivity with respect to the optical constants of the different experiments conducted here is important in the \gls{euv} spectral range, but neglicable for high photon energies.

A full list of the model parameters for the multilayer sample can be found in table~\ref{ch_spec:tbl_mo_b4c_si_c_multilayer_parameters} together with physically plausible limits for each of the parameters. Due to the fact that the \gls{euv} reflectivity curve shown in Fig.~\ref{ch_spec:fig_ptb17_reflectance_AOI_15} shows the first order Bragg peak of the layer system, none of the layers can be thicker than \nm{7}, i.e.~in the order of half of the wavelength. The barrier layers were designed to attain thicknesses below \nm{1}. The density of the various materials within this model was constrained to values between $\SI{50}{\percent}$ and $\SI{100}{\percent}$ with respect to their bulk density. Through possible defects in an amorphous layer compared to a crystalline structure, the bulk density may not be attained. Due to the high peak reflectance close to the theoretical limit, i.e.~the reflectance calculated for a given model without any roughness or intermixing present, of the multilayer sample in the \gls{euv} measurement, the maximum value of the N{\'e}vot-Croce factor was limited to be below $\sigma \leq \nm{2}$. With its upper limit, the measured peak reflectance can not be attained within this model thus not limiting the generality.

\paragraph{The minimization functional and particle swarm optimization}
As introduced above, the reconstruction of the model for the multilayer is primarily an optimization problem. Based on the measured reflectivity data an optimization functional defines the goodness of the model with respect to the measured data. The quality is asserted based on the method of least squares \cite{legendre_nouvelles_1805, gauss_theoria_1809, birge_calculation_1932} and the functional is defined as the reduced $\tilde{\chi}^2$
\begin{align}
\tilde{\chi}^2 = \frac{1}{M-P} \bigg[\sum\limits_{m} \frac{(I_m^\text{model} 
- I_m^\text{meas})^2}{\tilde{\sigma}_m^2} \bigg] \text{,} 
\label{ch_spec:eqn_reduced_chi_squared}
\end{align}
where $M$ is the number of measurement points, $P$ is the number of parameters used in the model, $I_m^\text{model}$ is the calculated intensity for the corresponding measurement point with index $m$ having the measured intensity $I_m^\text{meas}$. The calculated intensity fur the \gls{euv} reflectivity curve above $I_m^\text{model}$ follows directly from the matrix algorithm and the quantity $R$ in Eq.~\eqref{ch_theo:eqn_refl_trans_ML} in chapter~\ref{ch_theo}. Each point is calculated based on the angle of incidence and wavelength associated with measurement point $m$. The experimental uncertainty for each measurement point is described by $\tilde{\sigma}_m$.

For the minimization of the functional in Eq.~\eqref{ch_spec:eqn_reduced_chi_squared} we apply a global optimization algorithm known as \gls{pso} \cite{kennedy_particle_2011}. In contrast to the aforementioned gradient based methods, the \gls{pso} operates on the whole parameter space as defined by the upper and lower parameter limits, which are given in table~\ref{ch_spec:tbl_mo_b4c_si_c_multilayer_parameters} for the particular example here, without specific starting parameters influencing the convergence result. The \gls{pso} algorithm was implemented based on the draft by \textcite{carlisle_off--shelf_2001}. The basic mechanism of the algorithm is the definition of a swarm of individual particles, i.e.~positions in the parameter space associated with a directional vector, which are initialized randomly distributed between the defined space limits. Initially, each of those particles calculates the minimization functional at its random position retaining that result including a random start velocity. In an iterative process, the global best solution (``social component'') found as well as the individual best solution (``cognitive component'') of each particle are used to calculate an updated and weighted velocity vector within the parameter space for each particle. Within that iteration each of the particle thus moves to a new position, where the minimization functional is again evaluated and compared the the individual and global best solutions. If a better value is found, the respective retained results are updated with the new value and the next iteration is performed. While following that process the particles eventually converge to the global best solution, which may or may not be the global best optimum of the whole optimization problem. Due to the combination of social and cognitive component, fast convergence into a local optimum can be avoided. The state of full convergence is reached, when either all particles occupy the same place in the parameter space or if stagnation is reached. Due to the heuristic nature of the algorithm, it may happen that the global best optimum found is not necessarily the global minimum of the optimization problem. The result may be verified, however, by repeated application of the algorithm or simply by reaching a satisfactory solution through comparison of the measured and calculated curves and thus small $\tilde{\chi}^2$ values.

\paragraph{Model reconstruction based on the \gls{euv} reflectivity data}
We have applied this optimization procedure to the Mo/B$_4$C/Si/C sample and the measured \gls{euv} reflectivity curve. The fit result is shown together with the measured data in Fig.~\ref{ch_spec:fig_ptb17_reflectance_AOI_15_fitted}.
\begin{figure}[htbp]

\label{ch_spec:fig_ptb17_reflectance_AOI_15_fitted}
\end{figure}
The parameter results are listed in table~\ref{ch_spec:tbl_mo_b4c_si_c_multilayer_parameters_results}. The solution does indeed provide a very good agreement with the measured data. However, by repeated evaluation of the \gls{pso} procedure, significantly different results for the optimal parameter set with comparable agreement and very similar $\tilde{\chi}^2$ values were found. Three examples are listed in table~\ref{ch_spec:tbl_mo_b4c_si_c_multilayer_parameters_results} with their respective $\tilde{\chi}^2$ values. Clearly, this is no desirable situation, since no definite answer of the actual thicknesses found in the sample can be made. To complete the characterization additional methods of model verification are thus required. We shall therefore discuss an additional approach to the optimization problem in the following section on how the model validity and the information content of the measured data can be asserted based on the example of the \gls{pso} results obtained here.

\subsection{Model Uniqueness and Maximum Likelihood Estimation}  \label{ch_spec:sec_maximum_likelihood}
With the ambiguous reconstruction result of the previous section, the demand for a verification of the model with respect to the measured data becomes apparent. To clarify the problem of uniqueness of the solution, it is instructive to investigate the influence of the individual model parameters on the theoretical reflectivity curve. In Fig.~\ref{ch_spec:fig_mo_si_parameter_influence} we varied a subset of the parameters starting from the best \gls{pso} solution from Sec.~\ref{ch_spec:sec_multilayer_model_and_pso}. In each of the subfigures, one parameter or a quotient of parameters is varied while all others are kept fixed.
\begin{figure*}[htbp]
\centering
\includegraphics{img/parameter_influence}
\caption[Influence of the change of model parameters on the simulated EUV reflectivity curve.]{Influence of the change of model parameters on the simulated \gls{euv} reflectivity curve. In each of the figures, all parameters were kept constant at the values listed in table~\ref{ch_spec:tbl_mo_b4c_si_c_multilayer_parameters_results} varying only the respective shown parameter.}
\label{ch_spec:fig_mo_si_parameter_influence}
\end{figure*}
By comparison of Fig.~\ref{ch_spec:fig_mo_si_parameter_influence}a, \ref{ch_spec:fig_mo_si_parameter_influence}b, \ref{ch_spec:fig_mo_si_parameter_influence}c and \ref{ch_spec:fig_mo_si_parameter_influence}e it becomes clear that a reduction of the peak reflectivity can originate in either a large roughness and interdiffusion parameter $\sigma$ or similarly from the thickness of the capping layer, the silicon to molybdenum layer thickness ratio of the molybdenum density. A reconstruction based on a single \gls{euv} reflectivity therefore intrinsically produces a highly ambiguous result with strong parameter correlations. The available data, a single \gls{euv} reflectivity curve in this case, does not allow for a unique set of parameters of the model minimizing the $\chi^2$ functional. In reality multiple solutions with very similar values for $\tilde{\chi}^2$ exist as shown above. Clearly, this raises the question of how accurately a reconstruction may be achieved here.

\paragraph{Maximum likelihood}
A solution of the aforementioned problem requires to determine the value of $\tilde{\chi}^2$ in vicinity of the \gls{pso} solution or possibly the whole parameter space. We approach this by numerically sampling the functional based on a \gls{mcmc} method \cite{goodman_ensemble_2010}. An application of this technique to the design process of multilayer mirrors has been demonstrated by \textcite{hobson_markov-chain_2004}. In our case, the match of model and experimental result is evaluated based on a non-centered $\chi^2$ distribution assuming independent measurements. We further assume that any measured point is distributed around the actual reflectivity curve following a Gaussian distribution, i.e.~we assume Gaussian uncertainties for the experiment. The corresponding probability density function for a measurement result matching with the actual reflectivity curve, which is assumed to be obtainable exactly through the theoretical calculation, is then of Gaussian form \cite{abramowitz_handbook_1964}. Thus, the likelihood that the measured values match with the theoretical curve under the assumption that the model is correct is proportional to
\begin{align}
 L(E | M(\vec{x})) \propto \exp \big(- \tilde{\chi}^2(\vec{x}) / 2 \big) \text{,} \label{ch_spec:eqn_likelihood_experiment_vs_model}
\end{align}
where $E$ denotes the experiment, i.e.~the measured data and $M(\vec{x})$ represents the model given through parameter set $\vec{x}$, e.g.~the parameters of the model in table~\ref{ch_spec:tbl_mo_b4c_si_c_multilayer_parameters}. In our case however, we seek to evaluate the likelihood $L(M(\vec{x}) | E)$ that the model $M(\vec{x})$ with a given set of parameters $\vec{x}$ is valid assuming the experiment $E$ yields the correct curve (the so called ``posterior distribution''). Those two quantities are linked through the Bayesian theorem \cite{bayes_essay_1763, milton_introduction_2002} stating
\begin{align}
 L(M(\vec{x}) | E) \propto L(E | M(\vec{x})) L(M(\vec{x})) \text{,} \label{ch_spec:eqn_bayesian_theorem}
\end{align}
where $L(M(\vec{x}))$ denotes the likelihood for the model to be valid for a specific set of parameters $\vec{x}$ (the so called ``prior distribution''). The prior distribution does contain any prior knowledge about the model and allowed parameters. For the example of the model parameters in table~\ref{ch_spec:tbl_mo_b4c_si_c_multilayer_parameters}, the prior distribution is $L(M(\vec{x})) \rightarrow -\infty$ for any parameter set outside the listed boundaries and $L(M(\vec{x})) = 1$ everywhere else. In addition, we limit the maximum total period thickness, i.e.~the sum of all layers in one period to only allow the appearance of the first Bragg peak within the measured spectral range through the same condition. Combining Eq.~\eqref{ch_spec:eqn_likelihood_experiment_vs_model} and Eq.~\eqref{ch_spec:eqn_bayesian_theorem} then yields the likelihood functional
\begin{align}
 L(\vec{x}) = L(M(\vec{x}) | E) \propto \exp \big(- \tilde{\chi}^2(\vec{x}) / 2 \big) L(M(\vec{x})) \text{.} \label{ch_spec:eqn_likelihood}
\end{align}

Solving the optimization problem posed in the previous section within this context is then, equivalently to the minimization of $\tilde{\chi}^2$, the maximization of the likelihood $L(\vec{x})$. The \gls{mcmc} method poses a statistical approach on evaluating (mapping) the likelihood across the parameter space within the previously defined limits as in the \gls{pso} approach. It was proven that after a theoretical number of infinite iterations, the distribution of the individual samples within the \gls{mcmc} algorithm, corresponds to the likelihood functional in Eq.~\eqref{ch_spec:eqn_likelihood} \cite{cox_theoretical_1979, mackay_information_2003}. With a limited number of iterations, a numerical approximation of that distribution is obtained after reaching an equilibrium state in the algorithm \cite{foreman-mackey_emcee:_2013}. It thus yields an alternative method on solving the optimization problem by extracting the maximum likelihood from the final result. However, in addition to the maximum value, the likelihood distribution in parameter space is obtained allowing to extract confidence intervals for each of the parameters. Thereby, the aforementioned ambiguity of solutions can be quantified within the defined model and the available experimental data. The confidence intervals are defined as the one- or two-sigma standard deviations of the respective distributions for each parameter.

\paragraph{Confidence intervals for the Mo/B$_4$C/Si/C sample}
We have applied an existing implementation of the \gls{mcmc} algorithm by \textcite{foreman-mackey_emcee:_2013} to the \gls{euv} measurement of the Mo/B$_4$C/Si/C sample in Fig.~\ref{ch_spec:fig_ptb17_reflectance_AOI_15} with the model in Fig.~\ref{ch_spec:fig_Mo_B4C_Si_C_model}. The likelihood, as defined in Eq.~\eqref{ch_spec:eqn_likelihood} with the $\tilde{\chi}^2$ functional from Eq.~\eqref{ch_spec:eqn_reduced_chi_squared}, is sampled in a high-dimensional space depending on the number of parameters in the model. We therefore need to project the distribution for each parameter by marginalizing over all other parameters. Alternatively, two-parameter correlations can be visualized by projecting on a two-dimensional area, again marginalizing across all other parameters. The projection for the Si and Mo layer thicknesses are shown in Fig.~\ref{ch_spec:fig_ptb17_MCMC_d_Mo_vs_d_Si}b and \ref{ch_spec:fig_ptb17_MCMC_d_Mo_vs_d_Si}c. In both cases, a well defined distribution is obtained. In the two-dimensional projection in Fig.~\ref{ch_spec:fig_ptb17_MCMC_d_Mo_vs_d_Si}a, no correlations are apparent and a two-dimensional Gaussian-like shape results.

In all cases, the one-sigma standard deviations for Gaussian distributions are shown together with the weighted center, i.e.~the $50$th percentile. The \gls{pso} result is also indicated, which is compatible with the one sigma standard deviation, but does not match the center of the likelihood result. The reason for that lies in higher order correlations of the parameters. In Fig.~\ref{ch_spec:fig_ptb17_MCMC_other_params}, all one-dimensional projections of the likelihood distribution are shown for all remaining parameters. Clearly, while a reasonably small confidence interval (again, one standard deviation for all distributions) can be found for the thickness of the carbon and boroncarbite layers, the off-center value for the silicon thickness of the PSO result in Fig.~\ref{ch_spec:fig_ptb17_MCMC_d_Mo_vs_d_Si}c is compensated by a larger than center value for the boroncarbite layer in Fig.~\ref{ch_spec:fig_ptb17_MCMC_other_params}. Thus, the thicknesses are correlated and are no independent model parameters. Nevertheless, confidence intervals can be obtained within the given model and the given prior (the boundaries listed in table~\ref{ch_spec:tbl_mo_b4c_si_c_multilayer_parameters}) and are listed accordingly in table~\ref{ch_spec:tbl_mo_b4c_si_c_multilayer_mcmc_results} for one and two standard deviations. Within the allowed boundaries, some parameters remain entirely undefined with similar likelihood for any parameter value, such as the SiO$_2$ capping layer thickness, the silicon, carbon and boroncarbite relative densities. Their corresponding total confidence intervals thus cover almost exactly $68.2\%$ (one standard deviation) and $95.4\%$ (two standard deviations) of the allowed respective parameter range. Hence, with respect to the model defined and the measured \gls{euv} reflectivity curve, no reliable value for those sample properties can be determined.

It should be noted, that the given center values here are not a good solution to the optimization problem. The reason for that is, that the parameters are highly correlated. The center values of the one-dimensional projections may therefore not be suitable parameters for the model based on the low amount of data available. A valid optimization result can therefore only be obtained by either applying the \gls{pso} routine or by iterative application of the \gls{mcmc} procedure. The latter may be achieved by fixing single parameters according to their maximum likelihood value  found in the previous iteration and obtaining the resulting likelihood distributions for the remaining parameters according to that restricted prior distribution.

The results listed in table~\ref{ch_spec:tbl_mo_b4c_si_c_multilayer_mcmc_results} serve as the model parameters for the analysis of diffuse scattering from the Mo/B$_4$C/Si/C sample in chapter~\ref{ch_diff}.

\section{Molybdenum Thickness Variation in Mo/Si/C Multilayers} \label{ch_spec:sec_mo_si_c}
For the engineering of a near-normal incidence mirror, the ratio of molybdenum layer thickness to total period thickness has a clear impact on the reflectivity curve as seen from the theoretical simulations in Fig.~\ref{ch_spec:fig_mo_si_parameter_influence}c. Studies have shown, that an optimal value for high reflectivity is achieved by depositing $40\%$ molybdenum layer thickness $d_\text{Mo}$ with respect to the total period thickness $D$ \cite{bajt_investigation_2001,braun_mo/si_2002}. During the deposition process, the layer of molybdenum grows in thickness and at a certain threshold, crystallites may begin to form \cite{verhoeven_ion_1992,bajt_investigation_2001} inside the layer. Those may affect the interface morphology of the layer system at the boundaries to the molybdenum layer and possibly at further interfaces through correlation effects. This potentially increases the roughness and thus the loss of specularly reflected radiation to diffuse scatter.

In the following we shall apply and extend the reconstruction procedure discussed in the above section to the problem of multilayer sample systems deposited with varying molybdenum layer thicknesses from sample to sample. The samples discussed in this section were designed to investigate the impact of the crystallization on the performance on Mo/Si multilayer mirrors systems. Two sets of samples were fabricated. One with the standard magnetron deposition technique, which we shall refer to as \emph{unpolished samples} and another set with an additional ion polishing step applied within the deposition of each period to counteract the roughening expected from the crystallization process. Consequently, the latter samples are referred to as \emph{polished samples}. Both sets were deposited with linearly increasing molybdenum thickness across all periods from sample to sample. The details of the sample layout and the reflectivity measured from each sample are described in detail in Sec.~\ref{ch_spec:sec_mo_si_c_sample_systems_and_experimental}. 

The goal of this investigation is to analyze the interface morphology in each sample and asses the effect of the crystallization process and the polishing treatment. For that, the nominally deposited layer thicknesses are verified and the model including the determination of the densities and the interdiffusion and roughness parameters is reconstructed in Sec.~\ref{ch_spec:sec_MoSi_euv_xrr_combined} based on specular analytic experiments and the application of the \gls{pso} and the \gls{mcmc} methods introduced above. The findings are shown and discussed in Sec.~\ref{ch_spec:sec_mo_si_c_results}. The results presented here are part of the published work in \fullcite{haase_interface_2017}.

\subsection{Sample systems and experimental procedure} \label{ch_spec:sec_mo_si_c_sample_systems_and_experimental}
Two sets of several samples of Mo/Si/C multilayer mirrors with C interdiffusion barriers with thicknesses of nominally below \nm{0.5} at the Mo on Si interfaces (a detailed figure of the model for those samples is given below in Fig.~\ref{ch_spec:fig_model_unpolished_and_polished_samples} of the following sections) were prepared. As mentioned above, the samples under investigation here were fabricated with increasing relative Mo thickness from sample to sample while keeping the nominal period thickness $D\approx 7$ nm constant by correspondingly reducing the silicon layer thickness. In this study, we investigate two sets of samples. In the first set, the magnetron sputtered layers were deposited one after another for each sample. In the second set, during deposition, an additional polishing process was used once during sputtering each period to counteract the possible roughening due to the crystallization. The nominal thickness values of the molybdenum layers in the two sample sets were varied in equidistant steps, from \nm{1.7} to \nm{2.9} across nine unpolished samples. The polised set includes an additional sample with \nm{3.05} molybdenum thickness with identical values as in the unpolished case, otherwise. The nominal layer thicknesses refer to the value aimed at during production of the multilayer systems, realized by different deposition times for the respective layer material.

Spectrally resolved \gls{euv} reflectivity curves at an angle of incidence from the surface normal of $\alpha_i=\SI{15}{\degree}$ and in the wavelength range from \nm{12.4} to \nm{14.0} have been measured for all samples at the \gls{euvr} beamline at the \gls{mls}. The data obtained is shown in Fig.~\ref{ch_spec:fig_EUV_reflectivity_unpolished_and_polished} sorted by the nominal molybdenum layer thickness.
\begin{figure}[htbp]

\includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{img/MoSi_EUV_reflectivity}

\label{ch_spec:fig_EUV_reflectivity_unpolished_and_polished}
\end{figure}
The reflectivity curves in Fig.~\ref{ch_spec:fig_EUV_reflectivity_unpolished_and_polished}a and Fig.~\ref{ch_spec:fig_EUV_reflectivity_unpolished_and_polished}b have the characteristic curve shape of periodic \gls{euv} multilayer mirrors with a main broad maximum and side fringes, very similar to the mirror sample discussed in Sec.~\ref{ch_spec:sec_PTB17} above. In direct comparison of the measured reflectivity data, shifts of the peak center position are clearly visible. As illustrated in Fig.~\ref{ch_spec:fig_mo_si_parameter_influence} above, several properties of a multilayer stack, e.g.~molybdenum content and period thickness, contribute to such a difference. Clear differences in the maximum reflectivity value can also be observed in the two subfigures, with strong increases at $d_\text{Mo}^\text{nom} = \nm{2.45}$ for the unpolished set and at $d_\text{Mo}^\text{nom} = \nm{2.00}$ for the polished set. In all samples the only nominal difference, i.e.~the only parameter changed during the deposition process, is the relative molybdenum thickness. The increase in reflectance, peak broadening and the jump of the peaks center position are therefore indicators for an abrupt change in the multilayer properties.

For the purpose of obtaining additional information about the samples, in addition to the \gls{euv} reflectivity curves above, all samples were measured by Stefan Braun after deposition using a lab-based Cu-K$_\alpha$ X-ray diffractometer at the Fraunhofer IWS Dresden, Germany. The \gls{xrr} data is shown in Fig.~\ref{ch_spec:fig_MoSi_XRR} for the set of unpolished and polished samples in direct comparison.

In each of the subfigures a) and b) the \gls{xrr} measurements for the sample with smallest and largest $d_\text{Mo}^\text{nom}$ are shown on the bottom and the top of the subfigure, respectively. In between, the \gls{xrr} curves are shown in as a color map plot.}
\label{ch_spec:fig_MoSi_XRR}
\end{figure*}
The position of the Bragg peaks and their respective intensity contain additional information on the layer stack thicknesses and its interface properties. In both cases, shifts of the peak positions and intensities similar to those observed in the \gls{euv} curves become apparent. Especially the higher orders towards larger grazing incidence angles show distinct differences. In addition, in direct comparison of the \gls{xrr} curves for the respective sample with $d_\text{Mo}^\text{nom} = \nm{3.05}$ from the unpolished and polished sets (on the top of Fig.~\ref{ch_spec:fig_MoSi_XRR}a and Fig.~\ref{ch_spec:fig_MoSi_XRR}b), a higher intensity for higher-order Bragg peaks above grazing angles of incidence of $\alpha_i^\text{GI} > \SI{7}{\degree}$ can be observed for the polished sample. This hints towards an improved interface definition and sharpness due to the polishing process and consequently a lower roughness or interdiffusion.

In the following section we shall analyze the \gls{euv} and \gls{xrr} data discussed here to reconstruct a model of the samples using the \gls{mcmc} approach introduced in Sec.~\ref{ch_spec:sec_reconstruction_PTB17} in order to verify the observations made here.

\subsection{Combined Analysis of X-ray and EUV reflectance} \label{ch_spec:sec_MoSi_euv_xrr_combined}
To obtain the actual layer thicknesses in the samples, we analyzed the data of the \gls{euv} reflectivity and \gls{xrr} experiments and reconstructed these parameters by combined analysis of the measured data. The reflectivity curves for the different measurements are calculated by introducing a model for the multilayer system and applying the matrix formalism described in detail in the theory part of this thesis, Sec.~\ref{ch_theo:sec_matrix_algorithm}.

The thicknesses of the Mo layers inside the stack were varied nominally from $1.7$ nm to $3.05$ nm from sample to sample, where the unpolished sample set lacks the last nominal thickness. The stacking of the different layers in the multilayer consists of the Mo and Si layers, as well as an additional C buffer layer at the Mo on Si interface to prevent interdiffusion. For the Si on Mo interfaces, no buffer layers were included since interdiffusion is usually less in this case \cite{petford-long_highresolution_1987}. However, for the theoretical description of the sample stack we consider an additional MoSi$_2$ layer in the model, which is well known to form during the deposition process \cite{bajt_investigation_2001}. The full model used in the reconstruction is illustrated in Fig.~\ref{ch_spec:fig_model_unpolished_and_polished_samples} with the thickness parameters for each layer.

    \label{ch_spec:fig_model_unpolished_and_polished_samples}
\end{figure}
To account for any contamination on the top sample surface, an additional carbon-like layer as the upper most layer was considered. In addition to the thicknesses of each layer we also allowed for a variation of the layer density between $80\%$ and $100\%$ of the bulk density. The model parameters and their boundaries entering in the optimization procedure are listed in table~\ref{ch_spec:tbl_mo_si_c_multilayer_parameters}. Similar to the Mo/B$_4$C/Si/C in Sec.~\ref{ch_spec:sec_reconstruction_PTB17}, a N\'{e}vot-Croce damping factor was assumed to account for specular reflectivity loss due to interface imperfections.

\paragraph{Optimization functional and procedure} 
The data analysis was conduced similarly to the procedure described in Sec.~\ref{ch_spec:sec_reconstruction_PTB17}. However, for the samples studied here, two separate experiments and data sets were measured with the goal to improve the reconstruction of the model. Due to the increased amount of data through the additional \gls{xrr} measurements, a definition for a combined $\chi^2$ functional is required to allow an analysis based on both data sets. The two data sets, i.e.~the \gls{euv} and \gls{xrr} reflectivity curves have significantly different number of data points, which are not entirely independent of each other. In case of the \gls{xrr} curve increasing the number of data points, e.g.~by reducing the angular step size by half does not lead to better statistics due to systematic errors. Defining a $\chi^2$ functional as the total sum of all measured data point residuals, i.e.~both the \gls{euv} data and the \gls{xrr} data would therefore create an unwanted weighting due to the large amount of \gls{xrr} data points in comparison to far fewer \gls{euv} data points. To avoid this effect, we define the combined $\chi^2$ functional as the sum of the reduced $\tilde{\chi}^2$ functionals. The $\tilde{\chi}^2$ is equivalently defined to Eq.~\eqref{ch_spec:eqn_reduced_chi_squared} for each of the datasets separately. The reduced $\tilde{\chi}^2$ can be interpreted as the average of the squared residuals of model prediction and experiment. Thereby, each experiment is reduced to a single comparable quantity. By the definition of
\begin{align}
\chi^2 = \tilde{\chi}^2_\text{EUV} +\tilde{\chi}^2_\text{XRR} \text{,}
\label{ch_spec:eqn_Mo_Si_C_total_chi_2}
\end{align}
we are therefore enabled to obtain confidence intervals for the parameters of the model, which represent a conservative (upper limit) estimation for the combined analysis of both experiments, similarly to the procedure for a single \gls{euv} curve as described in Sec.~\ref{ch_spec:sec_reconstruction_PTB17} above. The combined $\chi^2$ functional enters the likelihood through Eq.~\ref{ch_spec:eqn_likelihood}.

The solution to the inverse problem of reconstructing the optimal model parameters is conducted by minimizing  the $\chi^2$ functional (or equivalently maximizing the likelihood). To minimize the functional with respect to the best choice of parameters, we apply the \gls{mcmc} method as described above for the Mo/B$_4$C/Si/C sample system. We do not start with a \gls{pso} optimization, since the sample system is numerically simpler due to the decreased amount of layers and interfaces. The \gls{mcmc} method itself yields an optimization result, although slower in convergence, as mentioned in the discussion of the procedure above in Sec.~\ref{ch_spec:sec_maximum_likelihood}. As a starting point, again a random set of parameters is generated with respect to predefined boundaries listed in table~\ref{ch_spec:tbl_mo_si_c_multilayer_parameters}. The limits are chosen in reference to prior knowledge and physical plausibility. Confidence intervals for each value within the underlying model are estimated from the likelihood distribution resulting from the \gls{mcmc} as one standard deviation of the sample distribution in each parameter.

We shall discuss the results of the optimization procedure at the example of the unpolished sample with nominal molybdenum layer thickness of $d_\text{Mo}^\text{nom} = \nm{3.05}$. The results of the \gls{mcmc} maximum likelihood estimation for the other samples were found to show the same properties and the same findings discussed in the following with the only distinction of broader or even improved distributions in some cases. The latter causes the confidence intervals to be different for the respective parameters.

As a first step, the \gls{mcmc} procedure was performed within the defined boundaries for all parameters. An unambiguous result was only found with respect to the thickness parameters of Mo, with the smallest confidence intervals in comparison to all other parameters, and Si, as well as for the N\'{e}vot-Croce parameter $\sigma$, whereas all other parameters show broad likelihood distributions within the predefined boundaries not allowing a unequivocal parameter determination. Therefore, the best model was obtained in a two-step process. First the \gls{mcmc} optimization was performed including all parameters as mentioned above. Proceeding from this, the value of the Mo thickness with its confidence interval was obtained by marginalizing over all other parameters, yielding the most precise parameter estimation from the procedure, i.e.~the smallest confidence interval. The results for the molybdenum and silicon layer thickness parameters are shown in Fig.~\ref{ch_spec:fig_Mo_Si_C_d_Mo_vs_d_Si}.

\label{ch_spec:fig_Mo_Si_C_d_Mo_vs_d_Si}
\end{figure*}
In comparison to the analysis based on only \gls{euv} data for the Mo/B$_4$C/Si/C in Fig.~\ref{ch_spec:fig_ptb17_MCMC_d_Mo_vs_d_Si}, the inclusion of additional \gls{xrr} measurements lead to significantly smaller confidence intervals and thus higher accuracy of the reconstruction. The method of combining the analysis of two datasets of \gls{euv} and \gls{xrr} measurements has been previously applied by others \cite{yakunin_combined_2014}, which have come to the same result of a significantly improved model reconstruction. Each of the methods does provide different sensitivity for the different model parameters. As an example, \gls{euv} measurements are sensitive to the Mo and Si layer thicknesses due to the large optical contrast in that spectral range. On the other hand, high accuracy can be expected from the \gls{xrr} measurements with respect to the period thickness parameter $D$.

In a second step, another \gls{mcmc} optimization was performed on a reduced parameter set, fixing the determined molybdenum layer thickness to its optimal value, i.e.~the $50\%$ percentile of its distribution. Finally, the layer thicknesses of the C barrier layer and the MoSi$_2$ interdiffusion layer were fixed to their nominal values of $d_C = d_{\text{MoSi}_2} = 0.5 $ nm. Due to the broad distribution result for the likelihoods of those parameters, this comes without a limitation of the generality for this analysis, since any value is valid within the predefined boundaries. Additionally, this ensures comparability of the models for all samples without constraining the applicability of the model with respect to the data available.

\label{ch_spec:fig_Mo_Si_C_correlation_Si_C}
\end{figure}
The results of the second \gls{mcmc} procedure of the restricted model yield the remaining values for the model parameters by obtaining the globally best solution found. The final result is indicated by the blue solid lines in Fig.~\ref{ch_spec:fig_Mo_Si_C_d_Mo_vs_d_Si}. Due to the choice to restrict the model to a buffer layer thickness of $d_\text{C} = \nm{0.5}$, we find the optimal solution for the silicon layer thickness at the limit of one standard deviation in Fig.~\ref{ch_spec:fig_Mo_Si_C_d_Mo_vs_d_Si}b. The distributions shown represent the \gls{mcmc} results of the unrestricted model, where the silicon and carbon layer thicknesses are strongly correlated as shown in Fig.~\ref{ch_spec:fig_Mo_Si_C_correlation_Si_C}. By fixing the carbon layer thickness to its nominal value, this correlation is resolved and the corresponding silicon layer thickness is well within the interval of one standard deviation as indicated through the solid black contours in Fig.~\ref{ch_spec:fig_Mo_Si_C_correlation_Si_C}.

The optimal parameters for the molybdenum layer thickness $d_\text{Mo}$ and the period thickness $D$ found for both sample sets in the two-step \gls{mcmc} analysis are shown in Fig.~\ref{ch_spec:fig_MoSi_fitted_mo_and_fitted_D}.

The nominal Mo layer thickness is shown in comparison in good agreement with the obtained thicknesses. b) Fitted total period thickness $D$ for both sample sets. For both sample sets, clear jumps can be observed at approx.~$d^\text{nom}_\text{Mo} =2.00$ nm and $d^\text{nom}_\text{Mo} =2.38$ nm, respectively, which is attributed to the crystallization threshold (see text). The marked (circle) samples were measured and analyzed with respect to the diffuse scattering.}
\label{ch_spec:fig_MoSi_fitted_mo_and_fitted_D}
\end{figure*}
The confidence intervals shown in Fig.~\ref{ch_spec:fig_MoSi_fitted_mo_and_fitted_D}a are one standard deviation of the likelihood determined for the Mo layer thickness by the first-step MCMC procedure, i.e.~for the unrestricted model with the parameter limits as listed in table~\ref{ch_spec:tbl_mo_si_c_multilayer_parameters}. The results show the desired linear increase in molybdenum layer thickness, however at a systematically higher thickness than the nominal values. A possible cause for that observation, consistent with the model reconstruction results, is the possible interdiffusion of the molybdenum layer with the silicon and carbon during deposition and a lower molybdenum density. The reduced relative density of the molybdenum layer is indeed found in the reconstruction results for all samples showing systematically reduced density values of $\rho_\text{Mo} \approx 90\%$ w.r.t.~the Mo bulk density. It is reasonable to assume, that the magnetron sputtered Mo layer, which is in mostly amorphous or polycrystalline state, leads to density reduced layers compared to fully crystalline bulk molybdenum. Thus, the nominal amount of deposited molybdenum leads to higher thicknesses than desired. In Fig.~\ref{ch_spec:fig_MoSi_fitted_mo_and_fitted_D}b the fitted period thicknesses $D$ are shown in dependency of the fitted molybdenum thicknesses.

For both sets, distinct jumps can be observed between $d_\text{Mo}\approx\nm{1.9}$ and $d_\text{Mo}\approx\nm{2.3}$ for the polished samples and between $d_\text{Mo}\approx\nm{2.3}$ and $d_\text{Mo}\approx\nm{2.7}$ for the unpolished set. To better understand this observation, Fig.~\ref{ch_spec:fig_EUV_peak_refl} shows the maximum peak reflectance of all \gls{euv} measurements as a function of the reconstructed Mo layer thickness.
\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{img/MoSi_EUV_peak}
\caption[Peak reflectance values for each Mo/Si/C sample in comparison with theoretical expectation.]{Peak reflectance values for each sample obtained from the \gls{euv} measurements for the unpolished sample set (a) and the polished sample set (b). The maximum theoretical reflectance is shown in both subfigures for a perfect (no roughness or interdiffusion) layer system with the same specifications as the samples.}
\label{ch_spec:fig_EUV_peak_refl}
\end{figure}
The identical blue solid line in both subfigures indicates the maximum peak reflectance attainable for a perfect multilayer system with the respective Mo layer thickness without any interdiffusion or roughness. For the calculation, a carbon capping layer of $d_\text{C(cap)} = 2.0$ nm and a relative density of $\rho_\text{C(cap)} = 0.5$ and a silicon dioxide layer of $d_\text{SiO$_2$} = 2.0$ was considered. The dashed curves in both figures show the expected maximum peak reflectance values for the two sample systems calculated by adding the respective roughness/interdiffusion to the model and varying the molybdenum thickness accordingly. In both cases, a significant dip with respect to the expected value can be observed starting at thicknesses of $d_\text{Mo} = 2.31({-0.22}/{+0.21})$ nm for the unpolished samples in Fig.~\ref{ch_spec:fig_EUV_peak_refl}a and at $d_\text{Mo} = 1.77({-0.22}/{+0.19})$ nm for the polished samples in Fig.~\ref{ch_spec:fig_EUV_peak_refl}b. We attribute this significantly diminished peak reflectance to the process of crystallization as the most likely cause. These values are consistent with the increase observed in the period thickness for both cases. Possibly, the deposition is affected by the crystallization threshold causing the increase in period thickness. The values measured here for the dip in peak reflectance are in agreement with earlier observation of molybdenum crystallization in literature \cite{bajt_investigation_2001} for the unpolished sample set. The polishing process shifts that threshold to lower thicknesses by approximately \nm{0.2} to \nm{0.3}.

For a deeper investigation of the interface morphology at the presumed crystallization threshold, \gls{euv} diffuse scattering experiments have been conducted for selected samples of the respective set. To gain a deeper understanding of the reflectivity dip and the period increase, the samples in vicinity of this feature in the Fig.~\ref{ch_spec:fig_EUV_peak_refl} and Fig.~\ref{ch_spec:fig_MoSi_fitted_mo_and_fitted_D} were investigated in comparison to reference samples above and below the threshold. The selection is marked with open circles in Fig.~\ref{ch_spec:fig_MoSi_fitted_mo_and_fitted_D}. This analysis is the topic of chapter~\ref{ch_diff} of this thesis and is described and discussed in detail there based on the model parameters obtained here.

 





\section{Analysis of Cr/Sc Multilayers with Sub-nanometer Layer Thickness} \label{ch_spec:sec_CrSc}
In the previous sections we have characterized multilayer systems designed to reflect radiation in the \gls{euv} spectral range from \nm{12.5} to \nm{14.0} wavelength. There, three to four layer systems per period with period thicknesses of $D\approx\nm{7}$ were used to achieve constructive interference at the desired reflection angles. We shall now apply the analysis to a different system, multilayer mirrors designed to reflect radiation in the spectral range between \nm{2.2} and \nm{4.4} wavelength, the so called \emph{water window}. Those systems share the basic principle of a one-dimensional Bragg crystal with the Mo/Si multilayer stacks from the previous sections, but differ in the selection of materials and their layer thicknesses. The intrinsic relationship between spectral range and period thickness to achieve constructive interference, requires period thicknesses of $D\approx \nm{1.5}$ for this case and higher number of period replications.


The system we investigate here is a bilayer stack of chromium (Cr) and scandium (Sc). A detailed description of the sample preparation process and the choice of the layer materials can be found in Ch.~\ref{ch_exp}, Sec.~\ref{ch_exp:sec_multilayer_design}. The sample is optimized to reflect radiation of $\lambda = \nm{3.14}$ at an angle of incidence of $\alpha_i = \SI{1.5}{\degree}$. It has $N=400$ bilayer periods, where the last period has a larger Cr capping layer thickness. The model of the sample is shown in Fig.~\ref{ch_spec:fig_Cr_Sc_model}.
\begin{figure}[htbp]

The periodic part is enclosed between the dashed lines with two layers in each period repeated $N=400$ times. The capping period does include the thicker chromium layer deposited to avoid oxidation of the periodic stack. Furthermore, oxide and carbon contamination layers are considered at the top surface.}
    \label{ch_spec:fig_Cr_Sc_model}
\end{figure}
The small period thickness of only $D\approx\nm{1.5}$ for this type of sample yields individual layer thicknesses in the sub-nanometer regime, for a bilayer period with approximately equal individual layer thicknesses. This is a significant difference to the Mo/Si systems treated in the beginning of this chapter, where the molybdenum and silicon layers were well above $>\nm{1.7}$. The exception in the previous case were the buffer and interdiffusion layers, which nominally have thicknesses below one nanometer and could not be characterized based on the methods employed above. In the Cr/Sc system investigated here, all nominal layer thicknesses are in that order of magnitude and are thus challenging to characterize. We shall therefore first compare the results obtained with an approach similar to the methods in the previous sections to establish a limit to the applicability of discrete layer models.

\subsection{Reconstruction with a discrete layer model approach} \label{ch_spec:sec_CrSc_resconstrution_binary}
In analogy to Sec.~\ref{ch_spec:sec_mo_si_c}, we seek to reconstruct the individual layer thicknesses based on experimental data. For this we construct a discrete layer model as illustrated in Fig.~\ref{ch_spec:fig_Cr_Sc_model} in analogy to the procedure applied for the Mo/Si multilayer systems. The parameters of this discrete layer model are listed in table~\ref{ch_spec:tbl_cr_sc_binary_parameters} together with the upper and lower bound for the particle swarm optimization procedure.

The reflectivity of the sample in the water window spectral range from \nm{3.12} to \nm{3.16} was measured at the \gls{sx700} beamline at \gls{bessy}. The angle of incidence was $\alpha_i=\SI{1.5}{\degree}$ (corresponding to a grazing angle of incidence of $\alpha_i^\text{GI} = \SI{88.5}{\degree}$), which corresponds to the design goal for this mirror prototype. In addition, similar to the Mo/Si samples, a \gls{xrr} measurement was 
conducted in the group of Sa\v{s}a Bajt at the DESY laboratory using a laboratory-based X-ray diffractometer 
(X'Pert PRO MRD, Panalytical). The diffractometer is equipped with a high-resolution goniometer and uses Cu-K$_\alpha$ radiation as a source. The \gls{xrr} intensities were recorded using a PIXcel counting detector. The dynamic range achieved in the measurements 
extended down to a reflectance of $10^{-6}$ for grazing angles of incidence of 
$\alpha_i=0^\circ$ to $\alpha_i=3^\circ$.

Both measurement curves are shown together in Fig.~\ref{ch_spec:fig_CrSc_EUV_XRR_data}.

  \label{ch_spec:fig_CrSc_EUV_XRR_data}
\end{figure}
Due to the short period of the multilayer sample, only two Bragg peaks could be observed in this angular range in the \gls{xrr} curve. All expected higher order peaks were below the detection threshold of $10^{-6}$ in reflected intensity. The dominating experimental uncertainty was the inhomogeneity of the sample stack across the sample area. The given uncertainty values for each of the measurement points were estimated, by measuring the peak reflectance of the \gls{euv} reflectivity curve on positions marking a cross of \mm{2} by \mm{2} in the sample center. This data was compared to theoretical expectance value based on a \gls{pso} fit of the discrete layer model above (for details of the optimization results see below). From this a drift of the period thickness of $D=\SI{2}{\pico\meter}$ was obtained and uncertainties were calculated as the difference of two theoretical curves attaining the maximum and minimum $D$ values. Similarly, uncertainties for the \gls{xrr} curve were calculated by simulating theoretical curves based on the same period drifts.

In comparison, the most remarkable difference with respect to the Mo/Si mirrors is the significantly reduced measured peak reflectance of the \gls{euv} curve in Fig.~\ref{ch_spec:fig_CrSc_EUV_XRR_data}a compared to the curves in Fig.~\ref{ch_spec:fig_ptb17_reflectance_AOI_15} and Fig.~\ref{ch_spec:fig_EUV_peak_refl}. The maximum experimental value attained is only approximately $R_\text{max} \approx 15\%$ while it is up to $R_\text{max} \approx \SI{70}{\percent}$ for the Mo/Si systems.

To better illustrate the differences to the Mo/Si systems, we have conducted an 
analysis based on the discrete layer model of a Cr/Sc multilayer as described above. The particle swarm optimization was done based on the EUV data shown in Fig.~\ref{ch_spec:fig_CrSc_EUV_XRR_data}a and the parameters and limits listed in table~\ref{ch_spec:tbl_cr_sc_binary_parameters}. The resulting parameters are listed in table~\ref{ch_spec:tbl_cr_sc_binary_pso_results}.

The capping layer results were obtained in a combined \gls{pso} analysis based on the \gls{euv} and \gls{xrr} data excluding the areas of the Bragg peaks. This grazing incidence reflectivity data has a very high sensitivity for the top surface layers, which can not be deducted from an \gls{euv} curve alone as demonstrated in Sec.~\ref{ch_spec:sec_reconstruction_PTB17}.

The theoretical curve obtained from the \gls{pso} procedure is shown in Fig.~\ref{ch_spec:fig_CrSc_binary_fit_vs_max_refl} in direct comparison with the theoretically achievable maximum reflectivity curve.
\begin{figure}[htbp]
  \centering

model. The green curve shows the maximum theoretical reflectance assuming a perfect multilayer system without roughness or interdiffusion.}
  \label{ch_spec:fig_CrSc_binary_fit_vs_max_refl}
\end{figure}
The latter was obtained by calculating the resulting reflectivity based on the parameter results in table~\ref{ch_spec:tbl_cr_sc_binary_pso_results}, but without any roughness or interdiffusion, i.e.~by requiring $\sigma \equiv 0.0$. The Sc 
to Cr ratio was found to be $\Gamma_\text{Sc}= d_\text{Sc}/d_\text{Cr} = 0.48$ with a \gls{rms} value of $\sigma=0.385$ nm for the N\'{e}vot-Croce factor. While the EUV reflectance curve shows excellent agreement with the measured data, there is a significant offset to the theoretically achievable maximum reflectance. For the particular model derived above, theoretical reflectance values of $R_\text{max} > \SI{50}{\percent}$ are possible. This large difference, especially compared to Mo/Si systems which are very close to the theoretically achievable maximum reflectance (cf.~Fig.~\ref{ch_spec:fig_EUV_peak_refl}), hints at strong roughness or intermixing of the two materials. To verify the applicability of the discrete (binary) layer model used here, the calculated curves for both experiments, the \gls{euv} and \gls{xrr} curve, are shown together in Fig.~\ref{ch_spec:fig_CrSc_binary_model_EUV_vs_XRR}.

A clear mismatch of the theoretical curve and the measured data can be observed for the second Bragg peak between $\alpha_i^\text{GI} = \SI{5.0}{\degree}$ and $\alpha_i^\text{GI} = \SI{6.0}{\degree}$.}
  \label{ch_spec:fig_CrSc_binary_model_EUV_vs_XRR}
\end{figure*}

Again, the \gls{euv} data is matched rather good, while in the case of the \gls{xrr} measurement only the first Bragg peak is found to be matched by the model also in the X-ray regime. However, the second Bragg resonance, clearly visible with a peak reflectance value of approximately $10^{-3}$ is not represented by the model at all. A fully
combined analysis similarly to the approach in Sec.~\ref{ch_spec:sec_mo_si_c} did not yield a consistent result. The \gls{rms} value for $\sigma$ required to reduce the theoretical EUV reflectance down to the measured 
level could not be brought into agreement with the existence of the second Bragg peak in the \gls{xrr} curve. In a strictly binary model like this one with a layer thickness ratio of 
$\Gamma_\text{Sc}\approx 0.5$, the second Bragg peak is additionally suppressed 
due to symmetry reasons. Thus, there is a clear mismatch of the model reconstruction and the experimental observations, mostly due to the complementary data delivered through the measurement of the second Bragg peak of the \gls{xrr} curve. This is a strong indicator, that the simple model as defined above does not suffice to describe the sample. Therefore, a more elaborate model is required introducing additional parameters to account for the increased complexity of the samples layer properties compared to the Mo/Si sample systems above.

\subsection{Extending The Model to Graded Interfaces and Interdiffusion} \label{ch_spec:sec_CrSc_gradual_model}
The physical structure of Cr/Sc multilayer systems with individual layer thicknesses in the sub-nanometer regime is significantly different than in case of the comparably large thicknesses of several nanometers in the Mo/Si case of the two preceding sections. It is well known \cite{prasciolu_thermal_2014}, that magnetron sputtered Cr and Sc multilayer systems, similarly to the Mo/Si systems, suffer from imperfect interfaces. Phase diagrams of Cr/Sc systems show, that the two materials do not like to mix or form composites at the interfaces \cite{boer_cohesion_1988}. That makes them an ideal candidate for chemically abrupt multilayer structures as needed for multilayer mirrors. However, due to the very thin layer structure, both materials are in an amorphous state and intermixing was in fact observed for multilayer structures similar to the one discussed here \cite{ghafoor_incorporation_2008}. Another possible reason is the magnetron sputtering deposition, which has shown to cause intermixing upon deposition \cite{eriksson_enhanced_2002}. In addition, roughness at the interfaces exists and further diminishes an ideal chemically abrupt transition from one material to the next. Due to the small layer thicknesses required to achieve the first Bragg resonance upon near-normal incidence with radiation of $\lambda=\nm{3.14}$, roughness and interdiffusion may occur over a zone as large as the total layer thickness itself. The results from the specular \gls{euv} and \gls{xrr} measurements shown above, clearly demonstrate that a binary model with only a N\'{e}vot-Croce damping parameter $\sigma$ does not provide an accurate model for the physical structure. Instead, a more complex model is required. Here, we define a periodic model to account for possible interdiffusion gradients and intermixing between the two materials in the stack. The symmetry of two identically thick layers within one period in the simple model above leads to a suppression of the second order Bragg peak. Nevertheless, physically this symmetry effect can be broken by interdiffusion zones with different thicknesses, depending on whether Cr was deposited on Sc or vice versa. Thereby, the second Bragg peak is no longer suppressed even though both layers have the same thickness if the interdiffusion zones are asymmetric. The model, which we use to reconstruct the Cr/Sc multilayer sample measured above is illustrated in Fig.~\ref{ch_spec:fig_CrScModel} in direct comparison to the simple model used before.

explicit gradual interfaces following a sinusoidal profile. The ideal interface 
profile is approximated through discrete sublayers as indicated in red, forming 
the actual gradual interface profile entering the electric field calculations. 
The thickness of the interdiffusion zones can differ for the top and bottom 
interface in each period. Their total thicknesses are given by $s_\text{Sc}$ 
and $s_\text{Cr}$. The effective index of refraction for both layers is given 
by $\tilde{n}_\text{Sc}$ and $\tilde{n}_\text{Cr}$, respectively.}
    \label{ch_spec:fig_CrScModel}
\end{figure*}
The interdiffusion zones are modeled following a sinusoidal profile, which represents a smooth transition from the refractive index of the Cr layer to the Sc layer and vice versa. The thickness of those zones is given by the parameters $s_\text{Sc}$ and $s_\text{Cr}$. For the calculation of the electromagnetic fields inside the stack, the interface region is sampled with a fixed number of equally spaced points in $z$-direction, effectively creating a region of thin sublayers with a gradually changing index of refraction (illustrated by the red stepped function in Fig.~\ref{ch_spec:fig_CrScModel}). To take into account intermixing extending across the full period, we introduced an intermixing parameter $\eta$. The effective indices of refraction of the individual Cr and Sc layers are then given through
\begin{align}
\tilde{n}_\text{Cr} &=(\eta/2) n_\text{Sc} + (1-\eta/2) n_\text{Cr} \text{,} 
\nonumber\\
\tilde{n}_\text{Sc} &=(1-\eta/2) n_\text{Sc} + (\eta/2) n_\text{Cr} \text{,} 
\label{eqn:effective_n} \\
&\text{for} \quad \eta \in [0,1] \text{,}\nonumber
\end{align}
where $n_\text{Cr}$ and $n_\text{Sc}$ are the tabulated values \cite{henke_x-ray_1993} 
with densities $\rho_\text{Cr}$ and $\rho_\text{Sc}$. Similarly as discussed in the case of the Mo/Si multilayer systems, the densities serve to consider unknown uncertainties in the tabulated values of the optical constants with respect to the actual case in the samples.

With the definition of the model as outlined above, natural restrictions arise for the parameters. As an example, the interdiffusion zone region can not extend across half of the thickness of the original layers total thickness described by the parameter $d_\text{Cr}$ or $d_\text{Sc}$, respectively. Instead, the intermixing parameter would have to be increased to account for that situation. The model is therefore parametrized according to the list of effective parameters given in table~\ref{ch_spec:tbl_CrSc_gradual_parametrization} together with their allowed ranges for the optimization procedure in analogy to the analysis conducted in the previous sections. The range limits arise either from physical plausibility or are intrinsic properties of the parameter definition.

Here, $D$ is the full period thickness, $d_\text{Sc}$ and $d_\text{Cr}$ are the 
nominal layer thicknesses of the Cr and Sc layers as indicated in 
Fig.~\ref{ch_spec:fig_CrScModel}, and $\rho_\text{Sc}$ and $\rho_\text{Cr}$ their 
respective densities with respect to their bulk densities 
$\tilde{\rho_\text{Sc}} = 2.989$ g/cm$^3$ and $\tilde{\rho_\text{Cr}} = 7.19$ 
g/cm$^3$ \cite{henke_x-ray_1993}. The loss of specular 
reflectance due to roughness-induced scattering is considered through the 
N\'{e}vot-Croce factor using $\sigma_\text{r}$ identical at each interface. This is necessary to account for diffusely scattered light, which is missing in the measured specularly reflected radiation but can not be attributed to contrast loss due to interdiffusion. The parameter $\Gamma_\text{Sc}$ indicates the portion of the Sc layer thickness 
with respect to the full period thickness $D$, which together uniquely define the thickness $d_\text{Cr}$; $\Gamma_\sigma$ describes the 
asymmetry of the widths of the interdiffusion zones at the Cr on Sc and Sc on Cr 
interfaces and is intrinsically limited to the interval $\Gamma_\sigma \in [0,1]$. Note that 
$s_\text{Sc}$ and $s_\text{Cr}$ are half periods of the sinus functions used to 
describe the interface profiles. Therefore the condition $s_\text{Sc} + 
s_\text{Cr} \leq D$ holds.

The discretization of the smooth interface profile in the interdiffusion zones introduces an additional numerical uncertainty through the number of discretization points $n$ required to reflect the physical situation of a smooth transition. To assert a lower limit for this number, we have evaluated the mean error introduced by coarse sampling. The most accurate experiment of the analysis within this chapter is given by the \gls{euv} reflectivity curve, which serves as a reference for this assertion through the sum of the squared uncertainty of each data point in Fig.~\ref{ch_spec:fig_CrSc_EUV_XRR_data}a, $\sum_m \tilde{\sigma}_m$. 

The numerical error of the model depending on the interface sampling through gradual sublayers was evaluated by comparing the sum of squares
\begin{align}
\chi_n &= \sum\limits_m (I^{n=100}_m - I^n_m)^2
\end{align}
of the difference of the theoretical \gls{euv} curves with increasing numbers of gradual interfaces and an ``ideal'' smooth transition represented by $100$ sublayers. The model parameters used for this analysis were obtained through a \gls{pso} optimization of the model with respect to the \gls{euv} reflectivity curve.

  \caption{Numerical uncertainty introduced through a coarse graded Cr/Sc layer model in comparison with the experimental uncertainty.}
  \label{ch_spec:fig_CrSc_numerical_uncertainty_mixlayer}
\end{figure}
As illustrated in Fig.~\ref{ch_spec:fig_CrSc_numerical_uncertainty_mixlayer}, the experimental uncertainty dominates at the lower limit of $n=10$ sublayers for the interface zone.
For the analysis is this chapter, and due to reasons of numerical effort required to calculate the electromagnetic field for all measurements discussed here, we use $n=15$ sublayers for all calculations. At that value, the experimental uncertainty is clearly dominant and only a marginal additional numerical error is acquired due to insufficient sampling.

As a verification of the applicability of the model to the problem of accurately representing the physical structure that could describe the \gls{euv} and \gls{xrr} data shown in Fig.~\ref{ch_spec:fig_CrSc_EUV_XRR_data} above, the combined analysis technique has been applied to the two data sets described in Sec.~\ref{ch_spec:sec_MoSi_euv_xrr_combined} based on the improved gradual model. The particle swarm optimization approach is used to obtain a global solution for the model parameters by minimizing the functional defined in Eq.~\eqref{ch_spec:eqn_Mo_Si_C_total_chi_2}. The results found for the gradual model are shown in Fig.~\ref{ch_spec:fig_CrSc_bianry_vs_gradual_model_fits}.

  \label{ch_spec:fig_CrSc_bianry_vs_gradual_model_fits}
\end{figure*}
The \gls{euv} reflectivity curves show visually indistinguishable fits for both, the binary model shown in Fig.~\ref{ch_spec:fig_CrSc_binary_model_EUV_vs_XRR} and the gradual model in Fig.~\ref{ch_spec:fig_CrSc_bianry_vs_gradual_model_fits}a. For the binary model, we have seen the distinct mismatch with the second order Bragg peak. For the gradual interface model, we see a significant improvement of the optimized result with a perfect match in both Bragg peaks of the \gls{xrr} curve in Fig.~\ref{ch_spec:fig_CrSc_bianry_vs_gradual_model_fits}d while also maintaining an excellent agreement with the \gls{euv} curve.

Based on the example of a combined analysis of \gls{euv} and \gls{xrr} data in this section, the gradual interface model clearly provides a more accurate representation of the sample than the binary approach by offering a reconstruction satisfying both data sets. At the same time, the results show that a verification of the model only becomes possible by adding complementary information. In case of the example above, that information is provided through the appearance of a second Bragg peak in the \gls{xrr} curve. Thereby, the limiting case of the binary model, which is still possible for the new gradual model, can be excluded with certainty through the comparison shown in Fig.~\ref{ch_spec:fig_CrSc_bianry_vs_gradual_model_fits}. The main difference of both models is the local gradual change of the index of refraction, which attributes for the fact that both materials may intermix. More importantly, both materials may intermix differently with respect to the specific interface, i.e.~the situation where Cr is deposited on top of Sc or vice versa. A key element of obtaining a reconstruction of that particular model is thus the application of experimental techniques, which can deliver information on the spacial distribution of the materials within one period.

At that point, it should be noted that other distortions of a perfect layer system can be imagined, which are not covered by a strictly periodic model as the one introduced above. Those include drifts of the period thickness $D$ across the stack or other systematic aperiodicities. In that case, however, a broadening of the peak or a distortion of the peaks symmetry, most prominently in the \gls{euv} curve, will be observed, which is not the case (for example, cf.~Fig.~\ref{ch_spec:fig_CrSc_drift} below). Although situations may occur, where the aperiodicities could lead to effects compensated by tuning the parameters of the gradual interface model, this assumption would assume a more complex situation than the simple assumption of periodicity and thus lead to a more complex, ill-defined model which could not be reconstructed.
To further strengthen that argument, we shall calculate the distortion occurring through a drift in the deposition process. This is a plausible systematic error, which could be caused by instabilities in the deposition process. Fig.~\ref{ch_spec:fig_CrSc_drift} shows the peak distortion for a drift of the total period thickness $D$ across the whole stack of $N=400$ periods by $d_\text{drift} = \nm{0.005}$ based on the model parameters for the curves in Fig.~\ref{ch_spec:fig_CrSc_bianry_vs_gradual_model_fits}c keeping the mean period thickness constant. Clearly, already this drift would cause a distortion of the peak symmetry with a significant minimum at $\lambda \approx \nm{3.136}$ and an additional shoulder at $\lambda \approx \nm{3.153}$, which is not observed in the data.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Addition of Complementary Experimental Methods}
Due to the increased complexity of the model, the question arises how accurately any parameter of the model can be determined and whether correlations exist and can be resolved (cf.~Fig.~\ref{ch_spec:fig_Mo_Si_C_correlation_Si_C} as an example for correlated model parameters in case of Mo/Si multilayer systems) based on the available data and whether further analytical measurements can improve the result as this was clearly the result for the combination of \gls{euv} and \gls{xrr} experiments shown above. For the particular case of the gradual interface model for periodic multilayer systems with sub-nanometer layer thicknesses, in total four experiments were conducted to study the applicability of each method with respect to finding a unequivocal reconstruction including confidence intervals. Only by systematically analyzing the strength and weaknesses of the employed analytic methods, a reconstruction of the model resembling the reality inside the sample becomes possible.

\subsubsection{Resonant EUV Reflectivity}
As seen for the four layer system discussed in Sec.~\ref{ch_spec:sec_reconstruction_PTB17}, confidence intervals for the individual layer thicknesses in the range below \nm{1} could not be obtained by exclusively analyzing the \gls{euv} curve. Similarly, the combined analysis of \gls{euv} and \gls{xrr} experiments in Sec.~\ref{ch_spec:sec_MoSi_euv_xrr_combined} did improve the result but still shows fairly large confidence intervals concerning the small total layer thickness in the Cr/Sc systems. For the particular system discussed here with possibly strong interdiffusion, a technique is required that yields the total amount of Sc and equivalently Cr within a single period. For that purpose, resonant reflectivity experiments in the \gls{euv} spectral range are promising. The knowledge of the optical constants are a necessary requirement for deducting quantitative information from that kind of experiment. In case of Sc, those were measured precisely for the Sc L3 and L2 absorption edges at approximately $\lambda_\text{Sc-L} \approx \nm{3.1}$ and below by \textcite{aquila_measurements_2004}. The real and imaginary parts obtained from that experiments are shown together with the respective optical constants of Cr in Fig.~\ref{ch_exp:fig_crsc_contrast} of Sec.~\ref{ch_exp:sec_multilayer_design}. To exploit the information contained in the optical constants of Sc, angular resolved reflectivity curves across the first Bragg peak were recorded at several wavelengths across the Sc L-edge. As the Cr dispersion is changing only marginally and smoothly across that wavelength range, any change of contrast and absorption can be attributed to the Sc in the multilayer. The corresponding measurements are shown in Fig.~\ref{ch_spec:fig_CrSc_REUV_data}.
\begin{figure}[htbp]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{img/CrSc_REUV_data}
  \caption[Measured resonant EUV reflectivity curves across the Sc L2 and L3-edge in logarithmic representation.]{Measured resonant \gls{euv} reflectivity curves across the Sc L2 and L3-edge in logarithmic representation. At each equidistant photon energy point, an angular resolved reflectivity curve was recorded across the Bragg peak.}
  \label{ch_spec:fig_CrSc_REUV_data}
\end{figure}
Each reflectivity curve was recorded within the interval from $\alpha_i = \SI{2.5}{\degree}$ to $\alpha_i = \SI{19.0}{\degree}$, with varying upper and lower boundary depending on the selected wavelength to incorporate only the range of the Bragg peak. The wavelength range was chosen between $\lambda = \nm{2.986}$ and $\lambda = \nm{3.128}$ including the Sc L2 and L3 edges. The resulting data is analyzed in analogy to the \gls{euv} reflectivity curves in Sec.~\ref{ch_spec:sec_CrSc_gradual_model} by applying the matrix algorithm on basis of the gradual layer model and the optical constants by \textcite{aquila_measurements_2004}. The experimental uncertainties taken into account for the \gls{reuv} experiment were estimated on basis of the multilayer inhomogeneity deducted as described for the \gls{euv} experiment in Sec.~\ref{ch_spec:sec_CrSc_resconstrution_binary}. It should be noted, that uncertainties for the measured optical constants were not given by the authors of the respective publication. Nevertheless, again by allowing a variation of the densities of the respective materials in the model, those are accounted for in the analysis. The variation, however, uses the same value for this density parameter for all analyzed curves. A missmatch of the individual reflectivity curves at the different energies with the theoretical calculation based on the results by Aquila~et~al.~is thus possible. This leads to a broadening of the likelihood distribtution, and thereby an increase of the confidence intervals reflecting the uncertainty in the optical constants determination. The details of the reconstruction based on this dataset are shown below in this section.

\subsubsection{Grazing Incidence X-ray Fluorescence}
In addition to the reconstruction of the Sc content via the \gls{reuv} experiment, spacial resolved measurements are necessary to deduct the interface profile in the gradual layer model. As discussed in Sec.~\ref{ch_spec:sec_CrSc_gradual_model}, asymmetric interface regions provide a possibility to observe a second Bragg peak in the \gls{xrr} measurement, even though both layers in the period have equal nominal thickness. To obtain information on that spacial distribution of both materials within a period, \gls{xrf} experiments exploiting the formation of a standing wave when scanning across the first Bragg peak were performed. The details of the method and how spacial sensitivity can be obtained are described in detail in Ch.~\ref{ch_theo}, Sec.~\ref{ch_theo:sec_xrf}.

The sample was measured exciting fluorescence of the Sc and Cr K-lines, which show the highest fluorescence yield for the core shell transitions. The K-edges for both materials are at energies of $E_\text{Sc-K} = \ev{4492}$ and $E_\text{Cr-K} = \ev{5989}$ \cite{elam_new_2002}. The experiment was therefore conducted at the \gls{fcm} beamline at \gls{bessy} in grazing incidence geometry at photon energies of $E_\text{ph} = \ev{5500}$ and $E_\text{ph} = \ev{6250}$, well above the respective edges as described in Ch.~\ref{ch_exp}, Sec.~\ref{ch_exp:sec_xrf_at_fcm}. Depending on which energy was used, the Bragg peak is found at grazing angles of incidence of $\alpha_i^\text{GI} \approx \SI{4.12}{\degree}$ and $\alpha_i^\text{GI} \approx \SI{3.62}{\degree}$, respectively. The measured relative fluorescence yield in the vicinity of the first Bragg peak is shown in Fig.~\ref{ch_spec:fig_CrSc_fluorescence_data} for both photon energies and materials. Here, due to the grazing angles of incidence, the method is referred to as \gls{gixrf}.
\begin{figure*}[htbp]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{img/CrSc_fluorescence_data}
  \caption[Measured relative X-ray fluorescence curves for the Cr and Sc K-lines across the first Bragg peak of the Cr/Sc sample.]{Measured relative X-ray fluorescence curves for the Cr and Sc K-lines across the first Bragg peak. a) Relative fluorescence yield of the Sc K-line at a primary photon energy of $E_\text{ph}=\ev{5500}$. b), c) Relative fluorescence yield for both materials at an primary photon energy of $E_\text{ph} = \ev{6250}$.}
  \label{ch_spec:fig_CrSc_fluorescence_data}
\end{figure*}
Since the photon energy of $E_\text{ph} = \ev{5500}$ is below the K-edge of Cr, only data for the Sc K-fluorescence exists. In the second case, fluorescence from both materials was detected. The measurement uncertainties were estimated from the scattering of the data for regions away from the Bragg resonance, where a flat curve is theoretically expected.

The fluorescence curves for Cr and Sc show distinctly different behavior and the expected curve shape (cf.~Fig.~\ref{ch_theo:fig_xrf_scheme}). For the analysis, the result at photon energies of $E_\text{ph}=\ev{5500}$ (Fig.~\ref{ch_spec:fig_CrSc_fluorescence_data}a)  was not taken into account, as the information is redundant to the result at  $E_\text{ph}=\ev{6250}$ (Fig.~\ref{ch_spec:fig_CrSc_fluorescence_data}b). As mentioned above, the theoretical description on how the relative fluorescence is calculated based on the gradual model is elaborated on in detail in Ch.~\ref{ch_exp}, Sec.~\ref{ch_exp:sec_xrf_at_fcm}.

\subsection{Reconstruction and Maximum Likelihood Evaluation}\label{ch_spec:sec_CrSc_results}
With the two additional measurements described above, five data sets (\gls{euv}, \gls{xrr}, \gls{reuv}, \gls{gixrf} (Sc) and \gls{gixrf} (Cr)) are available for the Cr/Sc multilayer sample to reconstruct the parameters of the gradual interface model. The full dataset, repeating and summarizing the relevant experimental results of this section in one figure, is compiled in Fig.~\ref{ch_spec:fig_CrSc_all_data}.
\begin{figure*}[htbp]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{img/CrSc_all_data}
  \caption[Full data set from the Cr/Sc sample used in the combined analysis.]{Full data set used in the combined analysis. Due to redundancy, the \gls{xrf} data for the Sc at a photon energy of $E_\text{ph}=\ev{5500}$ was omitted.}
  \label{ch_spec:fig_CrSc_all_data}
\end{figure*}

As in the combined analysis conducted for the Mo/Si/C systems in Sec.~\ref{ch_spec:sec_MoSi_euv_xrr_combined}, we define the minimization functional for the combined analysis of all the datasets as
\begin{align}
\chi^2 = \tilde{\chi}^2_\text{EUV} +\tilde{\chi}^2_\text{XRR} 
+\tilde{\chi}^2_\text{REUV} + 
\tilde{\chi}^2_\text{GIXRF(Sc)}+\tilde{\chi}^2_\text{GIXRF(Cr)}\text{,} 
\label{ch_spec:eqn_CrSc_total_chi_2}
\end{align}
where each of the reduced functionals is defined as given in Eq.~\eqref{ch_spec:eqn_reduced_chi_squared}. This functional corresponds to the combined $\chi^2$ functional defined in \eqref{ch_spec:eqn_Mo_Si_C_total_chi_2}, augmented by the additional measurements conducted here.

Firstly, similar as for the other two sample systems treated in this chapter, the parameters of the model, here the gradual interface model with the parameters and their limits listed in table~\ref{ch_spec:tbl_CrSc_gradual_parametrization}, were obtained using the \gls{pso} method to find a solution reproducing the experimental results. Secondly, following the maximum likelihood approach employing the \gls{mcmc} method as detailed in Sec.~\ref{ch_spec:sec_maximum_likelihood}, starting in the vicinity of this result the uniqueness and confidence intervals for each parameter were obtained. The final parameter results were obtained by taking the $50\%$ percentile of the resulting likelihood distribution for each parameter.

Through the minimization of the combined $\chi^2$ functional in Eq.~\eqref{ch_spec:eqn_CrSc_total_chi_2} via the \gls{pso} method, the best model parameters were obtained. It should be noted here, that in case of the \gls{xrr} curve, the analyzed data set was restricted to the two visible Bragg peaks which contain the information on the periodic part of the layer system. The data in between those does reflect the top surface layer thicknesses and was therefore analyzed separately to obtain the capping layer thicknesses after the optimization of the periodic part. The results for the capping layer thicknesses listed in table~\ref{ch_spec:tbl_CrSc_best_model_capping} was consequently used throughout the theoretical analysis for all experiments described here.

\subsubsection{Confidence Intervals and Evaluation of the Experimental Methods}
As discussed numerously throughout this chapter, the \gls{pso} ideally delivers the global minimum of the respective optimization functional. However, no information is obtained about the uniqueness and accuracy of the solution or correlation of parameters causing ambiguity of the results. Consequently, in addition to fitting the data with a particle swarm optimizer, the result was verified based on the \gls{mcmc} method described above to evaluate the confidence intervals for each parameter. To assess the performance of each of the experimental methods individually, the two step process, i.e.~the \gls{pso} fitting procedure followed by the \gls{mcmc} sampling, was conducted for each standalone experiment as well as for the combined optimization problem stated in Eq.~\eqref{ch_spec:eqn_CrSc_total_chi_2}.

The results are compiled in Table \ref{ch_spec:tbl_CrSc_MCMC_results}. The confidence intervals were calculated by evaluating the probability distribution as a result of the \gls{mcmc} procedure for each parameter. The confidence intervals given here represent percentiles of the number of samples found in the interval defined by the upper and lower bounds used for the \gls{pso} procedure for each parameter. In the case of 
a centered Gaussian distribution, percentiles of $2.3\%$ and $97.8\%$ of the integrated number of samples forming the distribution, mark the interval of four times the standard deviation, i.e.~$\pm 2\sigma$ in statistical terms. Due to potential asymmetries in the actual distributions found by the \gls{mcmc} method, explicit upper and lower bounds of the confidence intervals are given in table \ref{ch_spec:tbl_CrSc_MCMC_results} based on these percentiles. The best model value is calculated by the \gls{mcmc} sampling by taking the 50\% percentile, of the distribution of the numerical parameter samples.

  \label{ch_spec:fig_combined_fit_result}
\end{figure*}
Before discussing the achieved reconstruction and the corresponding confidence intervals of each of the methods in detail, we shall view the theoretical curves calculated from the best model of the combined analysis. The curves are shown in direct comparison with the data from Fig.~\ref{ch_spec:fig_CrSc_all_data} including the respective experimental uncertainties in Fig.~\ref{ch_spec:fig_combined_fit_result}. Clearly, the data and the solution found in the optimization procedure show excellent agreement indicating that the gradual interface model indeed provides a very good representation of the multilayer structure with respect to the experiments conducted here. Nevertheless, differences can be observed. The reason lies 
in the fact that the model is potentially still rather ideal. Small variations 
during the deposition process, for example, could lead to imperfections, which 
are not described in a strictly periodic model. However, including these by 
explicitly breaking the periodicity would lead to an ill-defined model 
with a vastly increased number of parameters and is thus not practical. Another 
reason is the deviation in the homogeneity of the sample, e.g.~a varying period 
across the sample, which causes mismatches if the measurement position varies 
slightly between the different experimental setups. The latter effects were 
considered in the uncertainties of the individual measurements by measuring the 
EUV reflectivity at positions $\pm 2$ mm from the center position and fitting 
the model. The result was a $\Delta D = 2$ pm shift in the period over $4$ mm 
across the sample.


\paragraph{Parameter correlations in the combined analysis}
With the optimized model parameters listed in table~\ref{ch_spec:tbl_CrSc_MCMC_results} and shown in Fig.~\ref{ch_spec:fig_combined_fit_result} for the combined analysis, a model reconstruction could be obtained explaining the data for each of the experiments. The \gls{mcmc} sampling of the likelihood functional based on the $\chi^2$ definition in Eq.~\eqref{ch_spec:eqn_CrSc_total_chi_2} yields the corresponding confidence intervals for all parameters given through the upper and lower bound as described above. Here, we shall illustrate and discuss in detail the resulting likelihood distributions obtained from the combined analysis, as they show that correlations of the parameters could be resolved and only persist for a single important case. For that, Fig.~\ref{ch_spec:fig_CrSc_cornerplot_combined} shows the full matrix of two- and one-dimensional likelihood distribution projections marginalizing over all other parameters. The details of how this figure is to be interpreted are described in detail above in Sec.~\ref{ch_spec:sec_maximum_likelihood} for the example of Mo and Si layer thicknesses obtained through fitting \gls{euv} reflectivity data.
\begin{figure*}[htbp]

  \caption[Matrix representation of the result of the maximum likelihood analysis for the Cr/Sc sample.]{Matrix representation of the result of the maximum likelihood analysis based on the \gls{mcmc} method for all parameter combinations. At the top of each column, the one-dimensional projection of the likelihood distribution for the respective parameter is shown in analogy to the figures \ref{ch_spec:fig_Mo_Si_C_d_Mo_vs_d_Si} or \ref{ch_spec:fig_ptb17_MCMC_other_params}. The dotted red lines indicate the $\pm 2 \sigma$ interval, i.e.~two standard deviations from the center value ($\SI{50}{\percent}$ percentile). The latter is indicated through the solid blue lines. In the two dimensional projections, the solid black contours mark the areas for one and two standard deviations, respectively. For a discussion of the observed features see main text}
  \label{ch_spec:fig_CrSc_cornerplot_combined}
\end{figure*}
Here, all possible gradual interface model parameter combinations are shown as two dimensional histograms together with the one-dimensional projection at the diagonal of the plot matrix. The solid blue line represents the values of the optimized model as listed in table~\ref{ch_spec:tbl_CrSc_MCMC_results} for the combined analysis column.

Generally, most of the parameter combinations do not show distinct correlations but approach the shape of a two-dimensional Gaussian distribution, which would be expected for a unique solution with corresponding uncertainty. It should be noted that in some cases, the distribution is truncated by parameter limits, which follow from physical or mathematical restrictions on the parameters as discussed in Sec.~\ref{ch_spec:sec_CrSc_gradual_model}, such as for the densities $\rho_\text{Sc}$ and $\rho_\text{Cr}$ as well as for the interface region ratio $\Gamma_\sigma$. In addition, the latter parameter shows a bimodal distribution for all two-dimensional histograms with clear emphasis on the lower value. That is a particularly interesting result of the combined analysis as it clearly demonstrates that only strongly asymmetric interface regions are minimizing the $\chi^2$ functional and it may thus be concluded that this corresponds to the actual structure present in the sample.

Finally, the parameter set of the \gls{rms} roughness $\sigma_r$ and the interdiffusion parameter $\eta$ show a ``banana shaped'' correlation significantly broadening the confidence intervals for both parameters in table \ref{ch_spec:tbl_CrSc_MCMC_results}. Fig.~\ref{ch_spec:fig_CrSc_eta_rho_correlation} shows a magnification of that particular histogram to better illustrate this property.
\begin{figure}[htbp]
  \centering
  \includegraphics{img/CrSc_eta_rho_correlation}

Again, the areas of one and two standard deviations are indicated together with the $\SI{50}{\percent}$ percentile as solid blue lines.}
  \label{ch_spec:fig_CrSc_eta_rho_correlation}
\end{figure}
The broad spectrum of values covered by the distribution in both parameters hints at a indistinguishability of those two model parameters, and consequently physical properties of the sample, based on the analyzed data. In fact, this conclusion can easily be understood as none of the applied experimental methods can separate the effect of roughness and interdiffusion. For better understanding this, we shall consider the relatively large beam footprint, with the smallest one of all experiments covering and area of approximately \mm{1} by \mm{1}, in comparison to the roughness dimensions and frequencies expected in the order of nanometers. Thereby, any reflected radiation or fluorescence radiation excited within the multilayer always represents an average of the rough interface morphology. That, however, can not be distinguished from a homogeneous layer with gradual interdiffusion along the surface normal of the sample. The solution to this problem of distinction is the analysis of diffuse scattering from the sample in addition to the combined analysis, which is the topic of the Ch.~\ref{ch_diff} of this thesis.

\paragraph{Confidence intervals depending on the employed method}
The confidence intervals of each experimental method differ significantly as table~\ref{ch_spec:tbl_CrSc_MCMC_results} shows. The reason behind this is the different sensitivity of the methods to the specific physical properties described by the respective model parameter. To better illustrate the information compiled in the table above, for each method and each parameter the total confidence interval is shown in Fig.~\ref{ch_spec:fig_CrSc_confidence_intervals} in a radial plot. The total confidence interval is defined as the difference of the upper and lower values as listed in table~\ref{ch_spec:tbl_CrSc_MCMC_results} for each experiment and parameter.

\end{figure}
The plot shows the four relevant experiments and the combined analysis results. Any value closer to the origin of the radial plot indicates a smaller confidence interval and thus a better accuracy of the solution found for the respective parameter.

It is worth noting that the confidence interval for the combined analysis is 
significantly smaller compared to the individual experiments for all parameters and therefore yields the best result. This is especially true for the parameter $\Gamma_\sigma$ describing the asymmetry of the interdiffusion layers. Within each of the individual experiments this parameter has a large uncertainty and can not be determined, whereas the combined analysis delivers a significant result of a clearly asymmetric interdiffusion layer thickness. In combination with the observations made above for the respective histograms in Fig.~\ref{ch_spec:fig_CrSc_cornerplot_combined}, we can conclude that this asymmetry is indeed a significant result and that the remaining fairly large confidence interval mainly results from the fact of having a bimodal distribution as the dotted lines in the respective histogram Fig.~\ref{ch_spec:fig_CrSc_cornerplot_combined} prove. A possible explanation for this asymmetry is the deposition process through magnetron sputtering. The elements Cr and Sc have different mass and thus different momentum when deposited onto each other. A similar effect is known from the deposition of Mo/Si multilayer systems, where the heavier Mo shows higher penetration into the Si layer than vice versa \cite{petford-long_highresolution_1987}. In the case of Cr/Sc multilayers, the Cr is heavier and thus has higher momentum leading to a broader interdiffusion layer, which is indeed also the interface region found to be the broadest by the analysis conducted here.

The comparison of the sensitivity, i.e.~the size of the confidence intervals, of each method further relveals, that the density parameters $\rho_\text{Sc}$ and $\rho_\text{Cr}$ can not be determined based on methods using X-ray radiation, such as \gls{xrr} and \gls{xrf}. This proves the claim made at the beginning of this chapter that the uncertainties of the optical constants, while relevant and considered through these density parameters for \gls{euv} experiments, do not impede the structural reconstruction using X-ray radiation. The fact, that the same density parameter was used for all measurements is, thus, not a limitation of the analysis method presented here.

The final result of this structural analysis of Cr/Sc multilayer systems with sub-nanometer layer thicknesses is shown in Fig.~\ref{ch_spec:fig_CrSc_electron_density_profile} by the depth dependence of the index of refraction in direct comparison with the initial binary model.

interface regions is clearly visible (see text). The gray and white shaded

As mentioned before, the most remarkable result of the combined analysis is the strong asymmetry of the interdiffusion layers. This can only be shown by the combination of all 
analytical experiments conducted here. In addition, the comparison shows that at no point within the periodic multilayer stack pure Sc or pure Cr layers are observed, but always a mixture of both. In the context of answering the question of poor reflectivity with respect to the theoretical possible maximum, this shows that intermixing is the main reason. The loss of contrast with respect to the binary model, causes the diminished reflectivity. However, it should noted that due to the correlation between roughness and interdiffusion this result is still to be verified by the aforementioned analysis of diffuse scattering. This is the topic of chapter~\ref{ch_diff} and analyzed there for the Cr/Sc system.
