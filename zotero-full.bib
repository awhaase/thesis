In addition, the top surface roughness of the multilayer stack is analyzed from Talystep profilometer measurements. These roughness data are used to obtain a roughness spectral density function to be used in a vector multilayer scattering theory. The theory uses three multilayer stack models to incorporate possible effects of different degrees of correlation between interfaces of the stack. It was found that the angular scattering calculated using the experimentally obtained roughness spectral density function agreed remarkably well with the measured angular scattering data. This is especially true if care is taken to differentiate between particulate and roughness scattering. For the sake of comparison, the angular scattering from an aluminum film is also given, and differences from scattering from the multilayer mirror are noted.},

We show how the frequency variations of this isotropy degree allow one to solve the inverse problem and obtain a unique solution for the scattering parameters that describe structural irregularities of the stacks.

	abstract = {The development of EUV lithography is critically based on the availability of suitable metrology equipment. To meet the industries requirements the Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB) recently has installed a new EUV reflectometer at the electron storage ring BESSY II. The new reflectometer is designed for at-wavelength metrology of full-size EUVL optics. Samples with a maximum weight of 50 kg and a diameter of up to 550 mm can be investigated. Besides wavelength and angle scans also the measurement of bi-directional scattering is possible within the full sample surface. Convex and concave shaped surfaces are allowed. Not only a single mirror of the projection optics but also up to five masks can be mounted simultaneously. For future lithography production tools the requirements for the optics and masks are very stringent. The homogeneity of the multilayer reflectivity across the surface and the wavelength matching of the peak reflection become even stronger than today. To meet the increasing demands not only regarding the sample size but also regarding the accuracy of the measurements the operation of the beamline was further optimized. Diffuse scattered light limits the uncertainty in the peak reflectance. A total relative uncertainty of 0.14\% is achieved with a reproducibility of 0.07\%. The uncertainty in the center wavelength is mainly given by the uncertainty for the reference wavelength of the Kr 3d5/2-5p resonance. The reduction of all other sources of uncertainty results in a total uncertainty of 0.014\% in the center wavelength with a reproducibility of 0.008\%. We present a detailed description of the EUV reflectometer and discuss the optimized beamline conditions with the different sources of uncertainties. The results are illustrated by recent measurements.},

	abstract = {Pulsed laser deposition (PLD) and magnetron sputter deposition (MSD) have been used to prepare different types of Mo/Si multilayers for the extreme ultraviolet (EUV) spectral range. In the case of PLD prepared Mo/Si multilayers the deposition of 0.3–0.5 nm thick carbon barrier layers at the interfaces leads to a substantial improvement of the interface quality. This can be deduced from Cu-Kα reflectivity measurements and HRTEM observations. Consequently the EUV reflectivity has been substantially increased. For pure Mo/Si-multilayers prepared by MSD the deposition parameters have been optimized so that a normal incidence reflectivity of R EUV =68.7\% could be realized. Although this is one of the best experimental results achieved so far, there is still a gap between this experimental value and the theoretical limit ( R EUV =75.5\%). One of the main reasons for this discrepancy is the formation of intermixing zones at the interfaces. With B 4 C and C barrier layers at the interfaces interdiffusion can be reduced. The resulting EUV reflectivity of this new type of EUV multilayers is 69.8\% (λ=13.42 nm, α=1.5°) and 71.4\% (λ=12.52 nm, α=22.5°).},

This method was applied to the reconstruction of the layered structure of a LaN/B multilayer mirror with 3.5 nm periodicity. We have compared profiles obtained by simultaneous EUVR and GIXR and GIXR-only data analysis, both reconstructed profiles result in a similar description of the layered structure. However, the simultaneous analysis of both EUVR and GIXR by a single algorithm lead to a \${\textbackslash}sim\$2x increased accuracy of the reconstructed layered model, or a more narrow range of solutions, as compared to the GIXR analysis only.

A simplified model is presented that introduces two parameters: Parameter δ describes optical thickness deviations from the perfect design, and parameter β describes the roughness evolution inside the coating according to a power law.

In the first step the comparison of light scattering and atomic force microscopy is completed by optical measurements at UV wavelengths that allow us to superimpose (and no longer extrapolate) the spectra measured by the two techniques. In the second step we extract multiscale parameters that describe the action of thin-film coatings on substrate roughness in all bandwidths. The results obviously depend on materials and substrates and deposition techniques. Electron-beam evaporation, ion-assisted deposition, and ion plating are compared, and the conclusions are discussed in regard to the deposition parameters. Finally, special attention is given to the limits and performances of the two characterization techniques (light scattering and atomic force microscopy) that may be sensitive to different phenomena.},

Factors such as variations of correlation with spatial frequency, residual roughness, and slight errors in the design are taken into account for comparison with the vector theory of angular scattering. Correlation of the interface roughnesses is found to be high for practically all coatings.

The scattering from multilayer mirrors leads to an intrinsic enhancement in off-specular intensity independent of roughness properties. The thickness oscillations in the scattering intensity (Kiessig fringes) are found to cause additional dynamic enhancement in analogy to Bragg-like peaks for grazing incidence geometry.
