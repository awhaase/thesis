Interface-engineered Sc/B4C/Cr multilayers showed increased thermal stability and higher reflectivity as compared to pure Sc/Cr multilayers.},

This allows to combine the high sensitivity of GIXR data to layer and interface thicknesses with the sensitivity of EUVR to the layer densities and atomic compositions. This method was applied to the reconstruction of the layered structure of a LaN/B multilayer mirror with 3.5 nm periodicity. We have compared profiles obtained by simultaneous EUVR and GIXR and GIXR-only data analysis, both reconstructed profiles result in a similar description of the layered structure. However, the simultaneous analysis of both EUVR and GIXR by a single algorithm lead to a \${\textbackslash}sim\$2x increased accuracy of the reconstructed layered model, or a more narrow range of solutions, as compared to the GIXR analysis only. It also explains the inherent difficulty of accurately predicting EUV reflectivity from a GIXR-only analysis.},

The results obviously depend on materials and substrates and deposition techniques. Electron-beam evaporation, ion-assisted deposition, and ion plating are compared, and the conclusions are discussed in regard to the deposition parameters.

	abstract = {Four industries prepared optical coatings with a common design that permits an easy determination of cross-correlation laws between the rough interfaces in the stack. Different pairs of materials and deposition processes were used. After clarifying the differences between scalar and vector theories of light scattering caused by rough interfaces in optical multilayers, we compare the experimental values with both theories. Factors such as variations of correlation with spatial frequency, residual roughness, and slight errors in the design are taken into account for comparison with the vector theory of angular scattering. Correlation of the interface roughnesses is found to be high for practically all coatings. However, at low scatter-loss levels, scattering by localized defects in the coatings appears to dominate over the scattering caused by rough interfaces.},

An isotropy degree of roughness is then introduced as a quantitative value to describe the angular disorder of a surface connected with the polar dependence of scattering. We show how the frequency variations of this isotropy degree allow one to solve the inverse problem and obtain a unique solution for the scattering parameters that describe structural irregularities of the stacks.

The theory uses three multilayer stack models to incorporate possible effects of different degrees of correlation between interfaces of the stack. It was found that the angular scattering calculated using the experimentally obtained roughness spectral density function agreed remarkably well with the measured angular scattering data. This is especially true if care is taken to differentiate between particulate and roughness scattering.

	abstract = {The development of EUV lithography is critically based on the availability of suitable metrology equipment. To meet the industries requirements the Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB) recently has installed a new EUV reflectometer at the electron storage ring BESSY II. The new reflectometer is designed for at-wavelength metrology of full-size EUVL optics. Samples with a maximum weight of 50 kg and a diameter of up to 550 mm can be investigated. Besides wavelength and angle scans also the measurement of bi-directional scattering is possible within the full sample surface. Convex and concave shaped surfaces are allowed. Not only a single mirror of the projection optics but also up to five masks can be mounted simultaneously. For future lithography production tools the requirements for the optics and masks are very stringent. The homogeneity of the multilayer reflectivity across the surface and the wavelength matching of the peak reflection become even stronger than today. To meet the increasing demands not only regarding the sample size but also regarding the accuracy of the measurements the operation of the beamline was further optimized. Diffuse scattered light limits the uncertainty in the peak reflectance. A total relative uncertainty of 0.14\% is achieved with a reproducibility of 0.07\%. The uncertainty in the center wavelength is mainly given by the uncertainty for the reference wavelength of the Kr 3d5/2-5p resonance. The reduction of all other sources of uncertainty results in a total uncertainty of 0.014\% in the center wavelength with a reproducibility of 0.008\%. We present a detailed description of the EUV reflectometer and discuss the optimized beamline conditions with the different sources of uncertainties. The results are illustrated by recent measurements.},

We prove that the determination of the interface roughness power spectral density (PSD) is only possible by considering geometry-dependent and dynamic contributions. The scattering from multilayer mirrors leads to an intrinsic enhancement in off-specular intensity independent of roughness properties. The thickness oscillations in the scattering intensity (Kiessig fringes) are found to cause additional dynamic enhancement in analogy to Bragg-like peaks for grazing incidence geometry. Considering these effects, the interface PSD is consistently determined.},

	doi = {10.1117/1.1489426},
	abstract = {Commercial EUV lithographic systems require multilayers with higher reflectance and better stability than those published to date. This work represents our effort to meet these specifications. Interface-engineered Mo-Si multilayers with 70\% reflectance and 0.545-nm bandwidth at 13.5-nm wavelength and 71\% reflectance with 0.49-nm bandwidth at 12.7-nm wavelength were developed. These results were achieved with 50 bilayers. These new multilayers consist of alternating Mo and Si layers separated by thin boron carbide layers. Depositing boron carbide on the interfaces leads to reduction in molybdenum silicide formation of the Mo-on-Si interfaces. Bilayer contraction is reduced by 30\%, implying that there is less intermixing of Mo and Si to form silicide. As a result, the Mo-on-Si interfaces are sharper in interface-engineered multilayers than in standard Mo-Si multilayers. The optimum boron carbide thicknesses have been determined and appear to be different for the Mo-on-Si and Si-on-Mo interfaces. The best results were obtained with 0.4-nm-thick boron carbide layers for the Mo-on-Si interfaces and 0.25-nm-thick boron carbide layers for the Si-on-Mo interfaces. The increase in reflectance is consistent with multilayers having sharper and smoother interfaces. A significant improvement in oxidation resistance of EUV multilayers has been achieved with ruthenium-terminated Mo-Si multilayers. The best capping-layer design consists of a Ru layer separated from the top Si layer by a boron carbide diffusion barrier. This design achieves high reflectance and the best oxidation resistance during EUV exposure in a water-vapor (oxidizing) environment. Electron-beam exposures of 4.5 h (in an effort to simulate EUV exposure perturbation of the top layers) in the presence of 5{\texttimes}10-7-Torr water-vapor partial pressure show no measurable reflectance loss and no increase in the oxide thickness of Ru-terminated multilayers. {\textcopyright} 2002 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers.},

The X-ray standing wave (XSW) field associated with GIXRF on flat samples is used here as a tunable sensor to obtain information about the implantation profile because the in-depth changes of the XSW intensity are dependent on the angle of incidence. This technique is very sensitive to near-surface layers and is therefore well suited for the analysis of USJ distributions. Si wafers implanted with either arsenic or boron at different fluences and implantation energies were used to compare SIMS with synchrotron radiation-induced GIXRF analysis. GIXRF measurements were carried out at the laboratory of the Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB) at the electron storage ring BESSY II using monochromatized undulator radiation of well-known radiant power and spectral purity. The use of an absolutely calibrated energy-dispersive detector for the acquisition of the B-K$\alpha$ and As-L$\alpha$ fluorescence radiation enabled the absolute determination of the total retained dose. The concentration profile was obtained by ab initio calculation and comparison with the angular measurements of the X-ray fluorescence.},

	abstract = {After having developed metrology with synchrotron radiation at the storage rings BESSY I and BESSY II for more than 25 years, particularly also for the characterization of EUV optical components and detectors, PTB extended its capabilities for EUV metrology with respect to polarization resolved measurements, particularly in the spectral region around 13.5 nm. With the development of larger numerical aperture optics for EUV and advanced illumination concepts for lithographic imaging, the polarization performance of the optical elements and EUV photomasks with respect to high-NA EUV imaging becomes ever more important. At PTB, we use monochromatized bending magnet radiation for the characterization of the optical elements because of the superior temporal stability and rapid tuneability of the wavelength. Thus the polarization of the radiation is almost linear, depending on the vertical beamline acceptance angle, and cannot be manipulated. Therefore, we decided to equip the soft X-ray beamline which delivers particularly well collimated and highly linearly polarized radiation with a sample manipulator which allows freely setting the orientation of the plane of deflection. Thus we are able to characterize samples in any orientation with respect to the linear polarized direction. We additionally can add a linear polarization analyzer working with a rotatable Brewster reflector to analyze the state of polarization of the reflected beam. We present first results on the polarization properties of EUV multilayer mirrors close to the Brewster angle where polarization selectivity up to s104 is predicted from model calculations. We also present polarization resolved measurements of the EUV diffraction of absorber line patterns at EUV photomasks.},

Diese m{\"u}ssen eine m{\"o}glichst hohe Reflektivit{\"a}t aufweisen, da diese die Effizienz des Verfahrens und damit den Durchsatz einer zuk{\"u}nftigen Chip-Fabrik ma{\ss}geblich bestimmt. In dieser Arbeit werden Untersuchungen zur Grenzfl{\"a}chenbeschaffenheit von Mo/Si Multischichten, die mittels Magnetron Sputter Deposition hergestellt wurden, vorgestellt. Ausgehend vom zweikomponentigen Mo/Si-System, bei dem vorrangig der Einfluss der Abscheidebedingungen auf die Grenzfl{\"a}chenrauhigkeit betrachtet wird, gelang es, durch den Einbau von d{\"u}nnsten Barriereschichten auch die Grenzfl{\"a}cheninterdiffusion zu reduzieren. Im reinen Mo/Si System ist vor allem ein niedriger Ar-Sputtergasdruck wichtig, um glatte Grenzfl{\"a}chen zu erzeugen. Die Verringerung der Interdiffusion der Mo- und Si-Atome kann durch den Einbau von C- und B4C-Barriereschichten geeigneter Dicke erreicht werden. Als Ergebnis der Untersuchungen wurden Mo/Si Multischichten mit momentan den weltweit h{\"o}chsten EUV-Reflektivit{\"a}ten pr{\"a}pariert: REUV = 70.1 \% ($\lambda$ = 13.3 nm, $\alpha$ = 1.5{\textdegree}), REUV = 71.4 \% ($\lambda$ = 12.5 nm, $\alpha$ = 22.5{\textdegree}).},

Because it moves around the space testing new parameter values, the point is well described as a particle. Because a number of them (usually 10 {\textless} N {\textless} 100) perform this behavior simultaneously, and because they tend to cluster together in optimal regions of the search space, they are referred to as a particle swarm.Besides moving in a (usually) Euclidean problem space, particles are typica ...},

	abstract = {The Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB) is currently constructing a low-energy electron storage ring in the close vicinity of BESSY II where PTB operates a laboratory for synchrotron-radiation-based metrology, mainly in the X-ray spectral region. The new storage ring, which is called {\textquoteleft}Metrology Light Source{\textquoteright} (MLS), will mainly be dedicated to radiometry and technological development in the UV, VUV and EUV spectral range and will thus fill the gap in the spectral range that has opened up since the shut-down of BESSY I. Moreover, the MLS will deliver intense radiation in the IR and FIR/THz spectral range. The MLS can be operated with parameters optimized for special calibration tasks, which, at a multi-user facility such as BESSY II, is rarely possible. The electron energy can be tuned in the range from 200 MeV up to 600 MeV and the electron beam current can be adjusted from 1 pA (single electron) up to 200 mA. All relevant storage ring parameters can be measured with high accuracy, thus making the MLS a source of calculable synchrotron radiation, i.e. a primary source standard. The MLS is designed in close co-operation with the BESSY GmbH, construction has started in the autumn of 2004 and user operation is scheduled to begin in 2008.},

	abstract = {The Multi-Spectral Solar Telescope Array (MSSTA) is a sounding rocket-borne observatory composed of a set of normal-incidence multilayer-coated telescopes that obtained selected bandpass spectroheliograms (44 to 1550 {\r A}) of the solar atmosphere. These spectroheliograms were recorded on specially fabricated XUV and FUV 70-mm Kodak film. Rocket launches of this instrument payload took place in 1991 (MSSTA I) and 1994 (MSSTA II) at the White Sands Missile Test Range in New Mexico, sponsored by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) sounding rocket experiment program. Immediately prior to the 1994 launch, visible light focusing tests of each telescope were performed in situ using a 1951 standard Air Force high-resolution test target, to measure optical resolution performance. We determined that the MSSTA II telescopes performed at diffraction-limited resolutions down to 0.70 arcsec at visible wavelengths. Based on these measurements, we calculate an upper bound to the focusing errors that incorporate the sum of all uncorrelated system focus errors that affect resolution performance. Coupling these upper bound estimates with the in-band diffraction limits, surface scattering errors and payload pointing jitter, we demonstrate that 11 of 19 MSSTA II telescopes{\textemdash}having negligible figures of focus errors in comparison to the corresponding visible diffraction limits{\textemdash}performed at sub arcsecond resolution at their operational FUV/EUV/XUV wavelengths during flight. We estimate the in-band performance down to 0.14{\textpm}0.08 arcsec. {\textcopyright} 2000 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers.},

	abstract = {A mixture of elements irradiated by a sufficiently energetic X-ray beam absorbs the incident X-rays and re-emits other X-rays, the wavelengths of which are characteristic of the elements in the sample, and the intensities of which may be correlated with their concentrations. The problem is to correlate Ifi, the intensity of the X-ray spectrum emitted by an element of atomic number Zi with c, $\mu$, and $\tau$ (concentration, absorption coefficient, and emission coefficient, respectively) of the elements in the sample. The correlation is complicated by the fact that the fluorescent radiation from elements of higher Z will excite additional radiation from elements of lower Z. Using integral methods, s mathematical analysis of the absorption-re-emission process yields explicit closed formulae, when the incident beam is monochromatic, for Ifi(c, $\mu$, $\tau$) in terms of logarithms and $\psi$-functions. A preliminary investigation suggests that the theory of means may offer a theoretical solution when the incident beam is polychromatic. Graphical methods make it possible to invert the formulae and express c in terms of Ifi, which makes chemical analysis possible. The use of a reference sample of known composition in the same elements as the sample in question, makes it possible to derive a close approximation to the chemical analysis when the incident beam is polychromatic. A brief comparison of computed and measured intensities from samples of known composition shows a good agreement. The report closes with appendices giving mathematical details, a numerical table of $\psi$(x), (0 ? x ? 1), and the fluorescence yields for some elements.},

An asymmetric-cut multilayer structure acts as a perfect blazed grating of high efficiency that exhibits a single diffracted order, as described by dynamical diffraction throughout the depth of the layered structure. The maximum number of grating periods created by cutting a multilayer deposited on a flat substrate is equal to the number of layers deposited, which limits the size of the grating. The size limitation was overcome by depositing the multilayer onto a substrate which itself is a coarse blazed grating and then polish it flat to reveal the uniformly spaced layers of the multilayer. The number of deposited layers required is such that the multilayer thickness exceeds the step height of the substrate structure. The method is demonstrated by fabricating a 27,060 line pairs per mm blazed grating (36.95 nm period) that is repeated every 3,200 periods by the 120-$\mu$m period substrate structure. This preparation technique also relaxes the requirements on stress control and interface roughness of the multilayer film. The dispersion and efficiency of the grating is demonstrated for soft X-rays of 13.2 nm wavelength.},

	doi = {10.1117/12.2191265},
	abstract = {The throughput of extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography systems is presently strongly limited by the available radiant power at the wafer level. Besides increasing the power of EUV sources, also the quality of the optical elements plays a key role. With state of the art multilayer mirrors the main cause of diminished reflectance is surface and interface roughness as well as interface diffusion. Both properties lead to reduced specular reflectance while only the interface roughness causes diffuse scattering. EUV diffuse scatter thus allows to selectively assess the contribution of the interface roughness. The intensity distribution of diffusely scattered EUV radiation provides information on vertical and lateral correlations of the surface and interface roughness through the appearance of resonant diffuse scattering (RDS) sheets. The study of off-specular scattering thus serves as a natural tool for the investigation of the roughness of the interfaces. However, upon near-normal incidence impinging EUV radiation, dynamical scattering contributions from thickness oscillations (Kiessig fringes) lead to Bragg lines which intersect the RDS sheets. This causes strong resonant enhancement in the scatter cross section which we called {\textquotedblleft}Kiessig-like peak" in analogy to the well known phenomenon of Bragg-like peaks appearing in hard X-ray grazing incidence measurement geometries. Thus for power spectral density studies of multilayer interface roughness, resonant dynamical scattering cannot be neglected. Theoretical simulations based on the distorted-wave Born approximation enable to separate dynamic features of the multilayer from roughness induced scattering. This allows to consistently determine an interface power spectral density (PSD). We have analyzed magnetron sputtered high-reflectance Mo/Si multilayer mirrors with different nominal molybdenum layer thicknesses from 1.7 nm to 3.05 nm crossing the Mo crystallization threshold.
Our off-specular scattering measurements at multilayer samples were conducted at the PTB-EUV radiometry beamline at the Metrology Light Source (MLS) in Berlin. The samples were produced by magnetron sputtering and pre-characterized by K$\alpha$ X-ray reflectivity at Fraunhofer IWS, Dresden.},

Dynamic scattering generates the so-called Yoneda band caused by a resonant scatter enhancement at the critical angle of total reflection and higher-order Yoneda bands originating from a subsequent diffraction of the Yoneda enhanced scattering at the grating.

It is shown that the analysis of multilayers by combined x-ray reflectometry (XRR) and x-ray standing-wave (XSW) techniques can overcome the deficiencies of the individual techniques in microstructural analysis. While interface roughnesses are more accurately determined by the XRR technique, the layer composition is more accurately determined by the XSW technique, where an element is directly identified by its characteristic emission. These aspects are explained with an example of a 20-period Pt/C multilayer. The composition of the C layers due to Pt dissolution in the C layers, PtxC1-x, is determined by the XSW technique. In the XSW analysis, when the entire amount of Pt present in the C layers is assumed to be within the broadened interface, this leads to larger interface roughness values, inconsistent with those determined by the XRR technique. Constraining the interface roughness values to those determined by the XRR technique requires an additional amount of dissolved Pt in the C layers to explain the Pt fluorescence yield excited by the standing-wave field. This analysis provides the average composition PtxC1-x of the C layers.},

This last approach is equivalent to the {\textquoteleft}fundamental parameters{\textquoteright} method but is presented in a simpler version adaptable to any mini-computer.},

Radiometry using synchrotron radiation has been performed by the German national metrology institute, the Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB), for almost 20 years. Recently, PTB has set up four new beamlines for EUV metrology at the electron storage ring BESSY II. At a bending magnet, a monochromator for soft X-ray radiometry is routinely used for reflectometry and detector characterisation. A reflectometer designed for mirrors up to 550 mm in diameter and 50 kg in mass will be operational in January 2002. Detector characterisation is based on a primary detector standard, a cryogenic electrical substitution radiometer. Measuring tools for EUV source characterisation are calibrated on this basis. Detector testing at irradiation levels comparable to the anticipated conditions in EUV tools is feasible at a plane grating monochromator, installed at an undulator optimised for EUV radiation. A test beamline for EUV optics alignment and system metrology has been installed, using undispersed undulator radiation. Bending magnet radiation is available at a station for irradiation testing. A focusing mirror collects a radiant power of about 10 mW within the multilayer bandwidth and a 1 mm{\^A}? focal spot.},

	abstract = {This paper is concerned with the properties of the radiation from a high energy accelerated electron, as recently observed in the General Electric synchrotron. An elementary derivation of the total rate of radiation is first presented, based on Larmor's formula for a slowly moving electron, and arguments of relativistic invariance. We then construct an expression for the instantaneous power radiated by an electron moving along an arbitrary, prescribed path. By casting this result into various forms, one obtains the angular distribution, the spectral distribution, or the combined angular and spectral distributions of the radiation. The method is based on an examination of the rate at which the electron irreversibly transfers energy to the electromagnetic field, as determined by half the difference of retarded and advanced electric field intensities. Formulas are obtained for an arbitrary charge-current distribution and then specialized to a point charge. The total radiated power and its angular distribution are obtained for an arbitrary trajectory. It is found that the direction of motion is a strongly preferred direction of emission at high energies. The spectral distribution of the radiation depends upon the detailed motion over a time interval large compared to the period of the radiation. However, the narrow cone of radiation generated by an energetic electron indicates that only a small part of the trajectory is effective in producing radiation observed in a given direction, which also implies that very high frequencies are emitted. Accordingly, we evaluate the spectral and angular distributions of the high frequency radiation by an energetic electron, in their dependence upon the parameters characterizing the instantaneous orbit. The average spectral distribution, as observed in the synchrotron measurements, is obtained by averaging the electron energy over an acceleration cycle. The entire spectrum emitted by an electron moving with constant speed in a circular path is also discussed. Finally, it is observed that quantum effects will modify the classical results here obtained only at extraordinarily large energies.},

The calculable spectral photon flux $\Phi$ E of a bending magnet with relative uncertainties of 4 {\texttimes} 10 -4 to 4 {\texttimes} 10 -3 for the photon energy 1 eV to 15 keV was used in a broad spectral range from the visible to the soft X-ray range for the calibration of radiation sources and energy-dispersive X-ray detectors. In 1998, BESSY II was brought into operation. Owing to its higher electron energy, of 1.7 GeV, the useful spectral range could be extended significantly into the X-ray region up to a photon energy of about 50 keV, while special storage-ring operation at 900 MeV results in a spectrum up to about 7 keV. The PTB has established BESSY II as a European primary source standard from the visible to the X-ray range by setting up equipment for the measurement of all storage-ring parameters and geometrical quantities involved in the calculation of $\Phi$ E according to Schwinger. At BESSY II, $\Phi$ E from a bending magnet can be calculated with a relative standard uncertainty of 3 {\texttimes} 10 -4 for photon energies below 3 keV, rising to 2 {\texttimes} 10 -3 at 50 keV.},

Up to now three generations of synchrotron radiation sources emitting radiation with increasing quality have been developed; the fourth generation, based on free-electron lasers, already produces high power and ultrafast pulses of highly coherent radiation. In the present contribution, the main characteristics and properties of the synchrotron radiation sources and of the produced radiation are introduced and explained using a simple approach.},

The radiation produced grows exponentially in intensity until it reaches a saturation point. We report on the demonstration of self-amplified spontaneous emission gain, exponential growth, and saturation at visible (530 nanometers) and ultraviolet (385 nanometers) wavelengths.

	abstract = {Multilayer mirror coatings which reflect extreme UV (EUV) radiation are a key enabling technology for EUV lithography. So/Si multilayers with reflectances of 67.5 percent at 13.4 nm are now routinely achieved and reflectances of 70.2 percent at 11.4 nm were obtained with Mo/Be multilayers. High reflectance is achieved with careful control of substrate quality, layer thicknesses, multilayer materials, interface quality, and surface termination. Reflectance and film stress were found to be stable relative to the requirements for application to EUV lithography. The run-to- run reproducibility of the reflectance peak position was characterized to be better than 0.2 percent, providing the required wavelength matching among the seven multilayer- coated mirrors used in the present lithography system design. Uniformity of coating was improved to better than 0.5 percent across 150 mm diameter substrates. These improvements in EUV multilayer mirror technology will enable us to meet the stringent specifications for coating the large optical substrates for our next-generation EUV lithography system.},

	abstract = {A novel ultra-high vacuum instrument for X-ray reflectometry and spectrometry-related techniques for nanoanalytics by means of synchrotron radiation has been constructed and commissioned. This versatile instrument was developed by the Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt, Germany's national metrology institute, and includes a 9-axis manipulator that allows for an independent alignment of the samples with respect to all degrees of freedom. In addition, a rotational and translational movement of several photodiodes as well as a translational movement of an aperture system in and out of the beam is provided. Thus, the new instrument enables various analytical techniques based on energy dispersive X-ray detectors such as reference-free X-ray fluorescence analysis (XRF), total-reflection XRF, grazing-incidence XRF in addition to optional X-ray reflectometry measurements or polarization-dependent X-ray absorption fine structure analyses. With this instrument samples having a size of up to 100 mm {\texttimes} 100 mm can be analyzed with respect to their mass deposition, elemental or spatial composition, or the species in order to probe surface contamination, layer composition and thickness, the depth profile of matrix elements or implants, the species of nanolayers, nanoparticles or buried interfaces as well as the molecular orientation of bonds. Selected applications of this advanced ultra-high vacuum instrument demonstrate both its flexibility and capability.},
